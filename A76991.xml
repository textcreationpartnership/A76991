         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſhall not ſpeake diſtinctly to all theſe which I have propounded; It will not ſute ſo well with my deſigne in this work. The firſt Doctrine might challenge ſomething by way of Introduction to what ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: and it might be ſerviceable to ſet off, and command this high priviledge of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall freedome. Contraries,
<note place="margin">Contraria contrariis illuſceſcunt.</note> they do inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one another. Something of <hi>heaven</hi> might be known from hell, and ſomething of the excellency of our Spirituall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, from the conſideration of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bondage: A bondage, 1. to Sinne; 2. to Satan; 3. to the Law. All which is firſt a Soul-bondage; and that Vniverſall bondage: ſecondly, a Cruell bondage: thirdly, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bondage: fourthly, a bondage out of which we are not able to redeeme our ſelves by price, or deliver our ſelves by power.</p>
            <p>But this firſt Doctrin we ſhall let goe for preſent, and what I might here ſpeake of it, I ſhall reſerve to ſome Application. The other foure I will ſum up into this one.</p>

            <p>And in this you have the whole Text.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170645:18"/>The <hi>Benefit</hi> freedome: The <hi>Qualitie</hi> of it, true and reall: The <hi>Subiects</hi> of it, true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; and the <hi>Author</hi> of it, Chriſt. <hi>If the Sonne ſhall make you free, then</hi> — All which makes this one Concluſion, <hi>That there is a true and reall freedome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the proſecution of this, we ſhall indeavour to do theſe <hi>three</hi> things. And ſo come to the Anſwer of thoſe Queries which induced me to enter upon this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We will ſhew you the <hi>Quality</hi> of this freedome here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We will ſhew you the <hi>Nature</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhall diſcover the <hi>parts</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And this briefly, that ſo we may come to that which I have chiefly intended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, what freedome that is for <hi>kinde,</hi> of which Chriſt doth here ſpeake, and into which Chriſt doth <hi>inſtate</hi> Beleevers. For the clearing of which, it is needfull to tell you that there are <hi>foure</hi> kinds of freedome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>naturall</hi> freedome. 2. <hi>Politicall.</hi> 3. <hi>Senſuall.</hi> 4. <hi>Spirituall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A <hi>Naturall</hi> freedome, ſuch a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as is in every thing by nature, every thing in nature injoyes a naturall freedome: but of this it is not ſpoken.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170645:18"/>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Politicall</hi> freedome, which is freedome of ſuch a Nation, ſuch a State, ſuch a Commonwealth, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and of this the Iewes thought Chriſt ſpake; they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and therefore free; but of this Chriſt did not ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a <hi>corrupt and ſinfull</hi> freedome, which we expreſſe under the word <hi>Libertiniſme:</hi> and the Apoſtle ſets downe in the 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 13. <hi>Brethren ye are called unto libertie; but uſe not libertie as an occaſion to the fleſh;</hi> that is, as an occaſion to ſinne; this is fearefull, to turne the <hi>grace</hi> of God into <hi>wantonneſſe,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the fourth of <hi>Iude, There are certaine men creept in unawares, who were of old ordained to the condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of God into laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who perhaps did reaſon with them, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> That they might <hi>abound</hi> in ſinne becauſe God hath <hi>abounded</hi> in grace; which was fearefull, no reaſoning of a child of God. And of the ſame men the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>As free, and not uſing your libertie as a cloake of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> that is, a pretence, or a colour to ſin. <hi>But as the ſervants of God,</hi> &amp;c. It is evill to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170645:19"/>ſinne, to <hi>doe any act of</hi> maliciouſneſſe, but much more to <hi>cloake</hi> it, cover it; and much more againe to <hi>make</hi> Chriſtian <hi>libertie</hi> the <hi>cloake</hi> of ſinne, that is moſt damnable; to make Religion, to make the truth of God, to make Chriſtian liberty ſo dearely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, a cloake or pretence to ſinne; or to take occaſion to ſinne by it, is a fearefull ſinne.</p>
            <p>But of this Chriſt doth not here ſpeake, this is our <hi>bondage,</hi> and not our <hi>freedome</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly freedome; a freedome <hi>purchaſed</hi> by Chriſt, <hi>revealed</hi> in the Goſpel, <hi>conveyed</hi> to the Saints, as the great <hi>dowry</hi> of Chriſt to his Church and Spouſe.</p>
            <p>There are two great things Chriſt hath intruſted into the hands of his Church: Firſt, <hi>Chriſtian faith.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And as we are to contend earneſtly for the <hi>maintenance</hi> of the faith, as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> 
               <hi>Iude</hi> 3. So alſo for the <hi>maintenance</hi> of Chriſtian libertie,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1.</note> againſt all oppugners and underminers of it. Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt made you free.</hi> And much like to this is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>You are bonght with a price, be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170645:19"/>no more the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23</note> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the generall then I ſay, the freedome into which Chriſt hath inſtated beleevers, is a <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> a <hi>divine</hi> freedome; a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in oppoſition to our <hi>former</hi> bondage. Which clearely underſtood, would diſcover what our freedome is. We come to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is the quality of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>qualitie</hi> in the Text: I ſhall but adde two more to it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a <hi>reall</hi> freedome, not an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, not a fancied freedome; there are too many who are imaginary free, and really in bondage: But this is no imaginarie free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; it is a freedome <hi>indeed,</hi> a true and reall freedome, whom the Sonne makes free are <hi>free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an <hi>univerſall</hi> freedome: a freedome which leaves us in no part of bondage: that look what ever was any part of our bondage before; in our liberty now, we are freed from it. But we muſt take heed of taking any part of our <hi>libertie</hi> for our <hi>bondage;</hi> or of our <hi>bondage</hi> for our <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> too many doe: as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170645:20"/>
            <p>We were then in bondage to Satan, to ſinne, to the law, to wrath, to death, to hell, &amp;c. And by this priviledge are freed from all, &amp;c. It is an Vniverſall freedome. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall in reſpect of perſons; all beleevers: and univerſall in reſpect of parts. We are free from all that was, or is any way part of our bondage: we are free from Satan, from ſinne, from the law: as I ſhall ſhew anon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>conſtant</hi> freedome: you are inſtated into a condition of freedome; a <hi>ſtate</hi> of freedome, as you were before in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of bondage.</p>
            <p>If ever the Lords <hi>Jubile</hi> was proclaimed and pronounced in the ſoule, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heare of a <hi>returne to bondage</hi> more; you ſhall never more returne into bondage to Satan; never come under the bondage to the Law more, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this Chriſt implies in the 8. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 35. <hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever, but the ſonne abideth for ever.</hi> The Apoſtle expreſſeth the ſame under an alluſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. where he diſtinguiſheth between thoſe who are under the law, and under the Goſpel; the children of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>free;</hi> the heires of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and the ſervants of the <hi>law;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:170645:20"/>the one muſt be <hi>caſt out,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo Chriſt here: <hi>The ſervant abides not in the houſe for ever;</hi> they ſhall not inherit, <hi>but the Son abideth in the houſe for ever;</hi> they ſhall inherit, they ſhall enjoy a perpetuall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, never again to return to bondage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We come now to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the parts of this freedome.</p>
            <p>Before I come to tell you what are the parts of our Chriſtian freedome, I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tell you that freedome in generall is divided into theſe two branches.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>inchoate</hi> freedome. Secondly, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate</hi> freedome, or the freedome we enjoy in the <hi>way,</hi> and the freedome of our Fathers <hi>houſe:</hi> the one in <hi>Grace,</hi> the other in <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall ſpeake chiefly to the firſt: the freedome of <hi>Saints</hi> here in <hi>Grace,</hi> which is our <hi>inchoate</hi> freedome. And we will briefly lay down the parts of it, which are two
<list>
                  <item>1. Privative.</item>
                  <item>2. Poſitive.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We will begin with the firſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are <hi>free</hi> from Satan: I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are freed from Satan. Chriſt hath wreſt us, and delivered us out of Satans hands. We were priſoners to Satan, even in his chains, but Chriſt hath delivered us. This is ſet down by way of parable in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170645:21"/>22. <hi>When the ſtrong man keeps the houſe, all is in peace: But when a ſtronger ſhall come, he ſhall ſpoyle him of his armour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he truſted,</hi> &amp;c. But plainly in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Chriſt came into the world, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, the devill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt freed us from the wrath of God by purchaſe,
<note place="margin">Non pretio dato ſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu potenti.</note> but from the devil by ſtrong hand. Indeed he bought us out of the hands of his Fathers juſtice by price; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Satan, as he delivered the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not by price, but by power; not by purchaſe, but by ſtrong hand. And this is the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Reatus. Regnum. Macula.</note> we are freed from ſinne. There are ſaid to be three things in ſinne. 1. The guilt of ſin. 2. The dominion of ſin. 3. The defilement of ſinne. I ſhall onely ſpeake unto two of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt hath freed us from the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin: yea of all ſin: which appeares in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That none of our ſinnes ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none of our ſins ſhall bring any fruits of wrath upon us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that none of our ſins ſhall be able to condemne us; Chriſt interpoſeth himſelfe between us and wrath, that none ſhall be able to condemne us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170645:21"/>condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deo et legi ſatisfeciſti in Chriſto, qui in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto es.</hi> Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</note> Chriſt himſelfe ſhall aſſoone be called to account for thy ſin as thou; if thou haſt an intereſt in him, ſinne ſhall never condemne thee, Chriſt hath ſatisfied for ſin.</p>
            <p>It were no juſtice for God to <hi>require</hi> the payment of Chriſt; nay to <hi>receive</hi> the full ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and to <hi>require</hi> any thing of thee. This God did, <hi>He laid on him the iniquitie of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53. and this hath Chriſt done; he paid God till he ſaid, he had enough; he was fully <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: <hi>This is my well-beloved Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.18. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>in quo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placui, in quo placatus ſum. Lege Bez. in</hi> Matth. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> in whom I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied and appeaſed. So the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. He was paying himſelfe out of the bloud, ſcourges, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt; and in that Chriſt made a full payment. Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.10. <hi>I ſend my Spirit, and he ſhall convince the world, as of ſinne, ſo of righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I goe to the Father, and ye ſhall ſee me no more;</hi> that is, you ſhall ſee me no more in this kinde; you ſhall never ſee me againe as a <hi>ſufferer,</hi> as a <hi>ſatisfier</hi> of Gods Iuſtice for ſinne more; I have done this. Indeed we ſhould have ſeen Chriſt againe if he had not ſatisfied Iuſtice; if but the guilt of one of thoſe <hi>ſinnes</hi> he bare had <hi>lien</hi> on him unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170645:22"/>for, it would have held him under <hi>chains</hi> of death, the <hi>power</hi> of the grave, for ever; he could never have <hi>riſen,</hi> much leſſe have <hi>aſcended,</hi> and gone to the Father, if he had not anſwered Iuſtice to the full. And therefore the Apoſtle makes a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, he ſets the death of Chriſt againſt what ever Sinne, Satan, Iuſtice, or Law can ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> He ſaies not, Who ſhall accuſe, but, who condemne? Indeed we may have <hi>accuſers</hi> enough, Sin, Satan, Conſcience, &amp;c. but none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: the iſſues of life and death are not in their hand. And as none of our ſinnes ſhall <hi>condemne</hi> us, ſo none of our ſinnes ſhall put us into <hi>a ſtate</hi> of condemnation more; none of our ſinnes ſhall ever put us under the curſe, under wrath againe. And that is the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="2">2. None of our ſins ſhall bring any fruits of wrath on us. We are freed from all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, calamities, afflictions, puniſhments, which yet are the fruits of ſin, as they may be conceived to be fruits of <hi>wrath,</hi> or have <hi>wrath</hi> in them.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170645:22"/>
            <p>If you take away the body, the ſhadow muſt needs be removed; ſinne is ſhe body, puniſhment the ſhadow that doth attend it and follow it: take away ſinne, and then the puniſhments are alſo taken away, all Gods diſpenſations are in mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For eternall puniſhments. All doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, thoſe can never lay hold of any of thoſe whom Chriſt hath freed from ſinne, thoſe whom he hath juſtified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For other puniſhments that have part of eternall puniſhments in them, any thing of the nature of wrath, from thoſe we are freed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And from all that beare relation, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, to any eternall puniſhment: theſe certainly beleevers are for ever freed from.</p>
            <p>I grant, that God doth afflict thoſe whoſe ſin he yet pardons, but there is a great deale of difference, both in the <hi>hand</hi> whence they come, the <hi>perſon</hi> that beare them, the <hi>grounds</hi> of inflicting; the <hi>ends</hi> that God <hi>aymes</hi> at in the inflicting them on us. As I ſhall ſhew afterward.</p>
            <p>God doth not afflict his people for ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As <hi>afflictions</hi> are part of the <hi>curſe</hi> for ſinne; ſo he cannot doe: So we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170645:23"/>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Afflictiones piorum non ſunt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriae, ſed caſtigato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae.</note> As they are <hi>payments</hi> for ſin, ſatisfactions for ſinne, as if Gods <hi>iuſtice</hi> were not full enough ſatisfied for ſinne by Chriſt, but he had left <hi>ſomething</hi> for us to beare in way of ſatisfaction; So the Papiſts ſay, (and therefore they penance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves) but ſo doe not we.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth not afflict his people for ſinne, as afflictions are the meere fruits of ſinne; for as they are the meere fruits of ſinne, ſo they are part of the curſe. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon wicked men are meerely penall part of the curſe: there is nothing medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in them, they are the effects of meere vindictive juſtice, and not of fatherly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. but afflictions on the godly, they are medicinall to cure us of ſinne.</p>
            <p>And this is the Firſt. Chriſt hath freed us from the guilt of ſinne, by which we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing elſe but that wrath, that puniſhment which is due to ſinne. Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Spirituall, Eternall. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Eternall puniſhments, we all agree God hath freed us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From Spirituall, as they have relation to eternall: So we muſt needs conclude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From Temporall, ſo farre as they have relation to either ſpirituall or eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; or, as they have any thing of wrath in them.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170645:23"/>
            <p>God hath thoughts of love in all he doth to his people: the <hi>grounds</hi> of his dealings to us is love, though the <hi>occaſion</hi> may be ſin, the <hi>manner</hi> of his dealings are love, and the <hi>end</hi> of his dealings are love. 1. Our <hi>good</hi> here, to make us partakers of his holineſſe; As the Apoſtle ſaith. 2. Our <hi>glory</hi> hereafter, to make us partakers of his glory.</p>
            <p>But now it is not ſo in Gods puniſhments of wicked men. Neither is the <hi>ground</hi> love, nor the <hi>manner</hi> love, nor the <hi>end</hi> love, all his <hi>dealings</hi> with them in this kind, they are <hi>parts</hi> of the curſe, and <hi>parts</hi> of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits for ſinne. And that is the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branch, he hath freed us from the guilt of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath freed us from the Dominion of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14, <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Why? <hi>for ſaith he, You are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> Indeed while we were under the law ſin had full dominion; it had not onely <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> in us, but <hi>dominion</hi> over us. And that dominion a <hi>voluntary,</hi> a <hi>willing,</hi> a <hi>free ſubiection</hi> and reſignation of our ſelves, to the motions and ſervices of ſin. Then we went downe <hi>ſtreame,</hi> winde, and tyde; there was both <hi>power</hi> of luſt, and luſtfull
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170645:24"/>
               <hi>inclinations</hi> to carry us: this was the <hi>tyde,</hi> the other was the <hi>wind.</hi>

            <p>Though ſtill we have the <hi>preſence,</hi> nay the ſtirrings and workings of corruptions, which makes us to have many a <hi>ſad</hi> heart and wet eye. Yet Chriſt hath thus farre freed us from Sinne, it ſhall not have dominion;

And ſo much ſhal ſerve for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170645:25"/>the ſecond. Chriſt hath freed us from ſinne, —</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath <hi>freed us from the law;</hi> that is another part of our freedome by Chriſt. We are freed from the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3.6. <hi>We are delivered from the law, that being dead to it, we ſhould ſerve in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſſe of the letter.</hi> Gal. 2.19. <hi>I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</hi> Gal. 5.18. <hi>If ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is another part of our freedome by Chriſt; we are freed from the law: But what this is we ſhall ſhew at large.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are freed from the <hi>Ceremoniall law,</hi> which was <hi>a yoke which neither me, nor our fathers were able to beare,</hi> Act. 15.20. But this is not all, here is but a <hi>ſmall</hi> part of our freedome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are freed from <hi>the Morall law.</hi> Firſt, as a <hi>Covenant</hi> ſay our Divines. It would ſave a great deale of trouble to ſay we are freed from the law, as a condition upon the obedience whereof we expected life. But take it in thoſe words, we are freed from the law as a Covenant; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will be then, what Covenant it is?</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170645:26"/>
            <p n="1">1. Some would have it a Covenant <hi>of workes,</hi> and yet will not have it <hi>oppoſite</hi> to the Covenant of <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some would have it a <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> but more legally diſpenſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some again would have it a <hi>mixt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> mixt of the Covenant of Nature, and of Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some again would have it a <hi>ſubſurvient Covenant;</hi> a Covenant given to them in way of ſubſerviencie to the Goſpel and Grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And others would have it <hi>no Covenant,</hi> but rather the <hi>repetition of</hi> the Covenant of works made with man in Innocency. And that God in giving of the law, did but <hi>repeat</hi> the Covenant under which we did, and doe ſtand, till we come over unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And this God did with <hi>mercifull</hi> purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to <hi>drive</hi> us out of our ſelves, and to <hi>bring</hi> us over unto Chriſt: As the Appoſtle ſeems to ſpeake when he demands this Queſtion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>But if the inheritance be not by the law, wherefore then ſerveth the law?</hi> the Appoſtle anſwers, <hi>the law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions till the ſeed ſhould come,</hi> that is, it was added to the promiſe, <hi>to diſcover tranſgreſſions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lex datur ut gratia quaeratur.</note> to make ſin and wrath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, to <hi>ſentence and humble</hi> us for ſinne. In
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170645:26"/>ſhort to make us to ſee the <hi>tearmes</hi> under which we ſtood; that ſo we might be <hi>brought out</hi> of our ſelves, and <hi>brought over</hi> to Chriſt; that we might expect nothing in <hi>relation to life</hi> from the law, or from our <hi>obedience</hi> to it, but all from Chriſt, who is our righteouſneſſe and peace.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not in this place <hi>debate</hi> theſe things, I have referred it to another place; onely I ſay, that the Scripture ſeemes not to hold forth, that it was the <hi>repetition</hi> of a Covenant, but that it was a Covenant it ſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4. &amp; 6. and expreſly in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And the Lord declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; even tenne Commandements, and he wrote them upon two Tables of ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee it is in expreſſe tearmes called a <hi>Covenant.</hi> And it is generally laid down by Divines as one part of our <hi>freedom</hi> by Chriſt, to be free from the law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And therefore I conceive they doe not underſtand it to be a Covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> onely legally diſpenſed; becauſe then it would be better ſaid, that we are free from the <hi>legall adminiſtrations</hi> of it, then from the <hi>thing it ſelfe.</hi> But they conceive it to be a <hi>Covenant of workes;</hi> yet not of <hi>life and death,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>ſtand or fall</hi> upon our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170645:27"/>obedience or diſobedience to it: So it were <hi>oppoſite to Grace,</hi> and could no way be conſiſtent with it: ſo it would ſpeake God <hi>contrary</hi> to himſelfe,

            <p>And this was the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> caſe, he was once one that expected, (as well he might) as much <hi>good</hi> from the law and his <hi>obedience</hi> to it as any man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I was alive, ſaith he, without the law once,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the knowledge of the law once:</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>when the commandment came, then ſinne revived and I dyed, and the commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death,</hi> that is, I found in ſtead of <hi>ſaving</hi> me, it <hi>killed</hi> me. It gave death inſtead of life. <hi>For ſaith he, ſinne taking occaſion by the law, deceived me, and by it ſlue me,</hi> that is, the law came in with an enlightning, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, accuſing, condemning <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>laid</hi> me on my <hi>backe,</hi> did cleane <hi>kill</hi> me, I ſaw I could expect nothing <hi>there,</hi> nothing from it as a <hi>covenant.</hi> And as the law was now <hi>dead</hi> to him, and could <hi>afford nothing</hi> to him, ſo was he now <hi>dead</hi> to the law, and <hi>expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing</hi> from it after. As he telles you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.</hi> That is, the law having now <hi>ſlaine</hi> me, I am for ever <hi>dead</hi> to it, I expect nothing from it as a covenant, all <hi>my life</hi> is in Chriſt.

It is dead to me, and I to it, and I look for all from Chriſt, — but thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the firſt. We are freed from the Law as a Covenant. Of which we ſhall ſpeake more largely in the Anſwer to the Queries: We will come to other branches of our Chriſtian freedome from the Law; which will hang upon this, if we looke upon it, as a Covenant of life and death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You are freed from the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Curſes</hi> of the Law. The Law requires <hi>two things</hi> of them who are under it. Either, that you ſhould <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>precepts</hi> which was impoſſible, in that ſtrictneſſe and rigidneſſe the law commanded them. <hi>Gal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10. <hi>Abrogata eſt ex quoad maledictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non quoad dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem.</hi> Cheami.</note> 3. or that we ſhould <hi>beare the penalties</hi> of the Law which are inſupportable. Either you muſt <hi>obey</hi> the commands, or <hi>ſuffer</hi> the Curſes of the Law; either <hi>doe</hi> Gods will, or <hi>ſuffer</hi> Gods will, in <hi>forfeitures</hi> of Soule and body: And in that ſad <hi>dilemma</hi> thoſe are who are under the Law, as a Covenant. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170645:29"/>already, the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore muſt needs be under the Curſes of the Law.</p>
            <p>But now thoſe that are beleevers, they are freed from the law, as a covenant of life and death. And therefore are free from the <hi>curſes and maledictions</hi> of the Law, the law hath <hi>nothing to doe</hi> with them, as touching their <hi>eternall</hi> eſtate and condition.</p>
            <p>Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> that is, to them who are not under the law.</p>
            <p>Were you indeed under the law as a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> there were <hi>condemnation,</hi> nothing elſe but <hi>condemnation.</hi> Though the law be not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> you, yet it is <hi>able</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> you, though not able to <hi>beſtow</hi> the <hi>bleſſing;</hi> yet it can <hi>poure</hi> the <hi>curſe</hi> upon you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law,</hi> (that is under the law, as a covenant that look for life and juſtification thereby) <hi>they are under the curſe.</hi> And he uſeth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, For it is written:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex nos reos facit juben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, &amp; non adjuvando,</hi> Aug.</note> 
               <hi>Curſed is he that doth not obey in all things, declaring</hi> he muſt needs be under the <hi>curſe;</hi> becauſe it is not poſſible to <hi>obey</hi> in all things, and to <hi>faile</hi> in any, you are left under the curſe.</p>
            <p>So that I ſay, were you under the law,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170645:30"/>the law is able to <hi>condemne</hi> you: though it cannot <hi>ſave</hi> you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
            <p>But now being in Chriſt, Chriſt hath freed you: from the <hi>curſes</hi> of the law, and that by <hi>bearing</hi> this curſe for you: as the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſtus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus longe fortior ad ſervandum per gratiam quam inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum per naturam,</hi> Beza.</note> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, by being made a curſe for us:</hi> he doth not onely ſay by bearing the curſe for us, but by being made a curſe for us.

You are freed from the Law as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo from the <hi>curſe</hi> of the Law, the Law cannot paſſe ſentence upon you, it cannot condemne you. 1.

            <p>And this priviledge is not onely for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> but for <hi>ever,</hi> though you ſhould ſinne, yet the Law cannot pronounce the curſe on you; becauſe you are not <hi>under</hi> the Law, becauſe ye are freed from the <hi>curſe</hi> of the Law: And the curſe can never take hold on thee.

               <hi>He hath blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and tooke it out of the way, nailing it to his croſſe;</hi> By hand-writing of Ordinances, I conceive is not meant the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law alone; but the <hi>Morall</hi> too, ſo farre as it was againſt us, So farre as it did bind us over to the curſe. And the Apoſtles <hi>Gradation</hi> is here obſerveable, <hi>he hath blotted out,</hi> but leaſt this ſhould not be enough, leaſt any ſhould ſay, it is not ſo blotted out, but it may be read, therefore he addes, <hi>he hath taken it away.</hi> But leaſt this ſhould not be enough neither, leaſt ſome might ſay; yea, but it will be found againe, and put in ſuit afreſh: therefore he addes, <hi>he hath nailed it to his croſſe,</hi> he hath torne it in pieces, never to be put together more. The Law ſhall never have <hi>any thing to ſhew</hi> for the ſinnes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Indeed it hath <hi>blacke bills,</hi> bloody inditements againſt ſuch who are under it: but it ſhall never have <hi>any thing to produce</hi> againſt thee, who haſt an intereſt in Chriſt;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170645:31"/>I may ſay of ſuch, as the Apoſtle doth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe, <hi>againſt ſuch their is no law.</hi> As there is no law to <hi>iuſtifie</hi> them, ſo there is no law to <hi>condemne</hi> them.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle ſhews plaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died.</hi> He ſets the death of Chriſt againſt all that can be brought. And it is evident.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Court</hi> cannot <hi>condemne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Court</hi> is <hi>condemned,</hi> the curſes, judgements, and ſentences of it are <hi>made</hi> invalid, and of no power
<note n="*" place="margin">Damnati linguam non vocem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent.</note> men that are condemned, they have a <hi>tongue,</hi> but no <hi>voice.</hi> So here, though the Law have a <hi>tongue</hi> ſtill to accuſe, yet hath it no <hi>power</hi> to condemne, it cannot faſten condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>Court</hi> cannot <hi>condemne</hi> you, becauſe you are not <hi>under</hi> it as a <hi>Court,</hi> you are not under the Law as a Covenant of life and death. If you be in Chriſt, you are under a Covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Court</hi> cannot <hi>condemne</hi> you: becauſe you are not under the <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of it, you are under the <hi>conduct,</hi> but not under the <hi>curſes</hi> of it, you are under the <hi>precepts</hi> (though not as the Law doth hold them out, upon theſe termes <hi>doe this and live,</hi>) but you are not under the <hi>penalty</hi> of it.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170645:31"/>
            <p>Fourthly, againe, that <hi>Court</hi> cannot <hi>condemne</hi> you, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our perſon and <hi>ſtead</hi> was <hi>condemned</hi> by it, that we might be <hi>freed.</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam vim condemnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, quia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit, et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnat in ipſis fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis non fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Ameſ. Luk. 18.</note> It may condemne <hi>ſinne</hi> in us: but cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us for ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that <hi>Court</hi> cannot condemn, becauſe you have <hi>appealed</hi> from it: you ſee this in the <hi>Publican,</hi> he was arreſted, dragged into the Court of juſtice, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced and condemned: but this takes no place becauſe he makes his <hi>appeale; God be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> he flies to Chriſt, and ſaith the Text, <hi>he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iuſtified.</hi> So that Court (provided your appeale be juſt) cannot condemne, becauſe you have <hi>appealed</hi> to the Court of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there be many who make a <hi>falſe</hi> appeale: they appeale in <hi>part,</hi> not <hi>wholly;</hi> they will truſt part on Chriſt, <hi>and part on themſelves.</hi> Many that <hi>appeale</hi> to Chriſt for <hi>ſalvation,</hi> who doe not <hi>appeale</hi> to him for <hi>ſanctification:</hi> this is falſe.</p>
            <p>Many who <hi>appeale</hi> to Chriſt before they be <hi>caſt</hi> in the former Court; before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170645:32"/>they be <hi>humbled,</hi> convinced, condemned in the law.</p>
            <p>You may read what kind of appeale will doe you good in the poore <hi>Publican;</hi> he ſeems a man caſt and condemned in the Court of the law, and thereupon makes his appeale to Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: Read the words, it is ſaid of him, <hi>He ſtood afarre off,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> 
               <hi>and would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to heaven; but ſmote his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Here was a three-fold demeanour, and it anſwers to a three-fold affection in him. Firſt, <hi>he ſtood afarre off;</hi> and this anſwers to his feare and conſternation: He <hi>would not ſo much as lift up his eyes;</hi> this anſwered to his ſhame and confuſion: <hi>He ſmote his breaſt;</hi> this anſwered to his ſorrow and compunction: and being thus caſt he then appeales: <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In briefe then, if thy appeale be right, and ſuch as will doe thee good; 1. It muſt be a <hi>totall,</hi> not a <hi>partiall appeale;</hi> you muſt not come to Chriſt for <hi>ſome</hi> reliefe onely, but for <hi>all.</hi> Chriſt muſt have the honour of all. 2. It muſt be an <hi>appeale</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> as well as <hi>mercy;</hi> for ſanctification,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170645:32"/>as well as ſalvation; to bee made <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by Chriſt, as well as to be made <hi>happy</hi> by Chriſt. 3. It muſt be the appeale of a man <hi>humbled</hi> and caſt in himſelfe. No man will appeale to <hi>another</hi> Court, till firſt he be <hi>caſt</hi> and condemned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. So here we cannot <hi>appeale</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till firſt we be <hi>caſt,</hi> condemned by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And this the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.9.</note> 3.9. <hi>We have proved both Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be all under ſinne. As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth, none that ſeeketh after God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the <hi>indictment,</hi> and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Law: and in ver. 19. you have the <hi>ſentence,</hi> or <hi>iudgement</hi> upon it; and there the Apoſtle tels you the <hi>reaſon,</hi> why the Law ſaith this; it is <hi>that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God.</hi> Now when the <hi>law</hi> hath <hi>accuſed,</hi> when it hath ſentenced us; <hi>ſtopt</hi> our <hi>mouthes,</hi> and we become guilty; now comes the <hi>ſinner</hi> to make his <hi>appeale</hi> from the <hi>law</hi> as a Covenant, to Chriſt as a <hi>Saviour:</hi> he lookes for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> but all from <hi>mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus appealed, the Law hath no more to doe with him; he is not

            <p>And what a <hi>priviledge</hi> is this, that you are free from the curſes and penalties of the law; that if the law <hi>threaten,</hi> Chriſt <hi>promiſeth;</hi> if the law <hi>curſe,</hi> Chriſt <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?</hi> this is a high priviledge: if God did but let one ſparke of his wrath and diſpleaſure fall upon your conſciences for ſin, you would then know what a mercy it were to be thus freed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You are freed from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments and accuſations</hi> of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> One would thinke, this a <hi>ſtrange</hi> queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall?</hi> why there is enow will lay to their charge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Satan, he is ready to lay things to their charge; he is called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.10. <hi>the accuſer of the Saints night and day;</hi> he is the great <hi>Calumniator,</hi> ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>Bils</hi> of indictment againſt the Saints: ſometimes he <hi>accuſeth God</hi> to man, as you ſee he did with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, where he <hi>charged God</hi> with envy to his creature, as if he had <hi>forbidden</hi> them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170645:34"/>that tree, becauſe they ſhould not be <hi>wiſe</hi> enough: and you ſee how ordinary it is with him, either to accuſe Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> when he tels them they may ſinne, and yet God will be mercifull; or his <hi>iuſtice,</hi> that if they ſinne, there is no mercy for them. As he <hi>ſtretcheth</hi> Gods juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>bounds</hi> of the Goſpel; ſo he <hi>ſtretcheth</hi> Gods mercy above the <hi>bounds</hi> of his truth.</p>
            <p>And as he <hi>accuſeth</hi> God to man; ſo man to God. 1. Either by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi> as you ſee in <hi>Ioſhua, Zach.</hi> 3.1, 2,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 3, 4. And thus he is ever laying crimes, and preferring Bills againſt the Saints. So that in all his temptations we may ſay, as the man to <hi>Ioab,</hi> when he asked why he killed not <hi>Abſolom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Thou thy ſelfe heard what the King commanded, that Abſolom ſhould not be hurt; and if I had done this thing thou thy ſelf would have been the firſt would have accuſed me to the King.</hi> So may we anſwer Satan; Thou thy ſelfe doeſt know that God hath <hi>forbidden</hi> this thing: and if I ſhould have done it, would not thou have beene the firſt that would have <hi>accuſed me to God?</hi> This is Satans way, he is firſt a <hi>tempter</hi> to draw us to ſinne, and then an <hi>accuſer</hi> to accuſe us to God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170645:35"/>for ſinning. 2. Or by way of <hi>ſuſpition</hi> and conjecture; as it was with <hi>Iob.</hi> God <hi>commends</hi> him, Satan <hi>condemns</hi> him; as if he knew <hi>Iob</hi> better then God himſelfe. Nay,
<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> and though he could not condemne his <hi>actions,</hi> yet he would quarrell with his <hi>affections.</hi> Surely, what ever his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are, yet <hi>Iobs intentions</hi> are not good; which was as much as to tell God that he was deceived in <hi>Iob,</hi> for certainly, what ever thou thinkeſt of <hi>Iob,</hi> yet <hi>Iob</hi> doth not ſerve thee for nought; he is a <hi>mercenary</hi> fellow, one that ſerves thee for loaves, belly bleſſings: thou haſt heaped out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward favours on him, and haſt made <hi>a hedge about him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10.</note> fenced him in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that nothing can annoy him. So that you ſee there are thoſe that will lay to the charge of Gods people. Satan will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Satan</hi> cannot condemne; the <hi>iſſues</hi> of life and death are not in his hands, nor ſhall his accuſation <hi>take place</hi> with God againſt us.

               <hi>Oh Satan. Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, but not onely Satan, but <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> men may accuſe us too: Sometimes <hi>iuſtly,</hi> of ſins committed, but forgiven; and herein they ſhew their malice and want of Charitie; not <hi>forgetting</hi> that which God hath <hi>forgiven.</hi> Sometimes <hi>uniuſtly,</hi> of things they never did; as <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phars</hi> wife accuſed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>incontinency,</hi> becauſe he would not be <hi>incontinent.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> complaines,

               <hi>They laid to his charge the things he never did:</hi> the like in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> But none can condemne us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, but not only Satan and wicked men, but <hi>conſcience</hi> it ſelfe may lay things to our charge. Conſcience may accuſe, and then how can we ſay, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? Conſcience, I ſay, may accuſe: 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bringing <hi>true light.</hi> 2. Sometimes <hi>falſe information.</hi> 3. Sometimes <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Bills</hi> cancelled, and croſſed long agoe.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170645:36"/>of conſcience when it doth charge us truely; <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Brethrens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſed them when they were ſo evil intreated in <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp; tels them, <hi>They were verily guilty of the wrong done to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Si non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo.</note> So <hi>David,</hi> after he had numbred the people, <hi>his heart ſmote him.</hi> Conſcience was not a <hi>bridle,</hi> but it was now a <hi>whip;</hi> it was not a <hi>curb,</hi> &amp; therfore now a <hi>ſcourge:</hi> he did not hearken to the <hi>warnings,</hi> and therefore feels the <hi>laſhings</hi> of conſcience: &amp; when conſcience doth juſtly accuſe us; when it comes in with <hi>evidence</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word, we muſt hear; for there <hi>God ſpeakes.</hi> If a <hi>Diall</hi> be not ſet by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> it is no matter what it ſayes; but if it goes by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> we muſt hearken to it: So if Conſcience doe not ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>word,</hi> we need not matter its <hi>accuſations:</hi> but if it ſpeak according to <hi>evidence</hi> there, it is good to liſten to it. 2. Sometimes Conſcience brings in <hi>falſe informations;</hi> it will perhaps tell you thoſe things to be ſinne which are not: and here it is an <hi>erroneous</hi> conſcience; we are not to heare it. 3. Sometimes it will bring in <hi>old</hi> caſes, anſwered and ſatisfied long agoe: then it is a quarrelſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Conſcience in this caſe is like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170645:36"/>a contentious troubleſome fellow at Law, &amp; God wil deal with it as an honeſt <hi>Iudge</hi> doth with ſuch a contentious quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome fellow; he caſts all out of <hi>Court,</hi> as matters not worth hearing; or things that have beene determined long agoe. Theſe accuſations ſhall not take hold of the ſoule. In this <hi>caſe</hi> I may ſay, when <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> condemnes, God is greater then conſcience to <hi>acquit</hi> and abſolve the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, but there is a fourth, which is ready to lay to the charge of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that is the <hi>Law:</hi> The Law may accuſe, &amp;c. And how then is it ſaid, Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods people? and if the Law may accuſe, we cannot be ſaid to be <hi>free</hi> from the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and accuſations of the the Law?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: If we ſpeake of ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; neither hath <hi>Conſcience,</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> nor the <hi>Law</hi> any right to accuſe the people of God. God hath juſtified, and who then ſhall accuſe?</p>
            <p>Indeed while we are <hi>under</hi> the Law, <hi>before faith;</hi> we are both under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, judgements, and ſentences of the Law. The Law doth not onely accuſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170645:37"/>us, but the ſentence and curſe takes hold of us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It <hi>accuſeth</hi> us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.45. as Chriſt told them that would not beleeve in him, but looked for juſtification by the Law;
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.45.</note> 
               <hi>Doe not thinke that I will accuſe you to the Father, there is one that will accuſe you; even Moſes in whom you truſt:</hi> that Law which they looked to be juſtified by, ſhould accuſe them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not onely accuſe us, but <hi>ſentence</hi> us; yea and the ſentence and curſe <hi>takes hold</hi> of us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned already.</hi> And in the 36. verſ. <hi>He that beleeveth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that while you are <hi>under</hi> the Law, before faith and <hi>intereſt</hi> in Chriſt, the law doth not onely <hi>accuſe;</hi> but the law doth condemne.</p>
            <p>But now thoſe that have an <hi>intereſt</hi> in Chriſt: 1. The law cannot <hi>accuſe</hi> them of ſinne <hi>before</hi> grace; becauſe they are pardoned; and this accuſation is made void. 2. The law cannot <hi>accuſe</hi> of ſinne <hi>after</hi> grace, ſinne after a pardon. They are not under the accuſations, arreſts, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, the law cannot ſo accuſe us
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170645:37"/>of ſinne, as to <hi>call</hi> us into that <hi>Court,</hi> as the word doth ſignifie <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.

For we are (when beleevers) freed from it as a Court, as a Covenant, and ſo from the judgements, ſentences, condemnations, curſes, and accuſations of it. If it ſend any of its <hi>Officers</hi> out to accuſe us, and attach us for ſinne, we may <hi>refuſe</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, to come in and <hi>appeare;</hi> becauſe we are to be tried by another Court: we are to be <hi>tryed</hi> by the Goſpel. And did Gods <hi>people,</hi> when they have ſinned, goe to the right Court, they might both <hi>ſooner</hi> get <hi>ſorrow</hi> for ſinne, and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of pardon of ſinne; they would find <hi>more ſorrow</hi> and <hi>leſſe horrour</hi> for ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When I ſay, we are <hi>freed</hi> from the accuſations of the law: I meane <hi>accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of it as <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold accuſation.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170645:38"/>
            <p>Firſt, An accuſation to <hi>conviction</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> for ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An accuſation to <hi>ſentence</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> for ſinne, the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth and condemneth alſo, all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Law to them who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, they are <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to Sentence, Iudgement, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ſinne: the Law accuſeth and alſo condemneth all them under it. But all the accuſations of the godly for ſinne they are in <hi>ſubordination</hi> to <hi>conviction</hi> for ſinne, and <hi>humiliation</hi> for it, and ſo ſubordinate to life and ſalvation, &amp;c. And ſo I conceive the Law may <hi>accuſe</hi> thoſe who are yet the <hi>Freemen</hi> of Chriſt. It may diſcover to them how farre they come ſhort of the glory of God, how farre they have erred and wandered from the paths of righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them for it, but this accuſation is to humiliation, not to condemnation. As I ſhall ſhew hereafter: either this muſt be ſo, or elſe you muſt deny the Law from being a Rule.</p>
            <p>But here two <hi>Queries</hi> are propounded.</p>
            <p>Whether the Law may juſtly accuſe us,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quere. </seg>1</label> ſeeing we are not under it.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170645:38"/>
            <p>In briefe I Anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> we are not under the <hi>curſes,</hi> but we are under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of it; we are not under the Law for <hi>iudgement,</hi> but we are under the Law for <hi>conduct.</hi> So farre as we walke not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, as a Rule, it hath an <hi>accuſing power,</hi> though we are taken out of the <hi>condemning power</hi> of it. There is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>power left</hi> in the Law then for our <hi>good,</hi> our humiliation, our edification. And this is onely a power for our good, and our furtherance in grace.</p>
            <p>Whether the Law is <hi>iuſt</hi> in its accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us, ſeeing we doe not ſinne.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quere. </seg>2</label> And that is founded upon the former; if it be true, that we are freed from the Law as a Rule, or as a Direction of life, (which yet ſo to be freed were not a part of our freedome but our bondage) then our breaches of the Law are not ſinne;
<note place="margin">D. <hi>C.</hi> Seems to ſpeake to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his, Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>p.</hi> 245.</note> if no Law for us, then we doe not ſinne in the breaking of it, no more then we doe, if we breake now the Laws of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or any other Nation, which is no law for us: as ſome doe ſeeme to exemplifie this.</p>
            <p>Theſe two <hi>Queries</hi> the invalidneſſe of them, and danger of them, we ſhall ſhew afterwards; in the meane I muſt tell
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170645:39"/>you, that the Law in its <hi>directive power</hi> doth remaine to us. And this muſt needs be plaine from <hi>Galathians</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Law was given</hi> 430. <hi>years after the Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the Law was given 430. yeares after the Promiſe, then either as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or as a <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as a <hi>Covenant</hi> it could not be given; for then were God contrary to himſelfe, firſt in giving a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> then of <hi>Workes.</hi> And therefore he gave it as a <hi>Rule,</hi> to diſcover to us after Iuſtification by the Promiſe, a Rule of walking with God to all manner of pleaſing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> That can never be ſaid to be part of our <hi>Freedome,</hi> which is a part of our <hi>Bondage:</hi> or that can never be ſaid to be part of our <hi>Bondage,</hi> which is part of our <hi>Holines.</hi> But conformity to the Law, and ſubjection to the Law of God is part of our holines: Therefore it can never be ſaid to be part of our <hi>Bondage.</hi> Indeed there is a <hi>Two-fold ſubiection,</hi> The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a Son, and of a Slave. We are <hi>freed</hi> from the one, the <hi>ſubiection</hi> of a <hi>Slave,</hi> this was part of our <hi>Bondage;</hi> but not from the other, the ſubjection of a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170645:39"/>Son, it is part of our <hi>Freedome.</hi> But I will not anticipate my Diſcourſe, wee ſhall come to ſpeake to this at large in our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,

Theophil.</note> We are freed from the <hi>rigour</hi> of obedience required in the Law, wee are not freed from <hi>exact</hi> obedience; but from that <hi>rigour</hi> of obedience which the Law required unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Law did not only command <hi>difficult,</hi> but <hi>impoſſible</hi> things of us; it laid a <hi>yoke</hi> upon us which we could not bear, and it would not, nor could it give us the leaſt <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> and concurrence. Like the Scribes and Phariſees, who <hi>laid heavie yokes and burthens upon mens ſhoulders; but would not touch them with one of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi> So the Law, it laid heavie yokes upon us, but gives us not the leaſt aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and concurrence of <hi>ſtrength</hi> for the doing of it. <hi>Iubet, ſed non iuvat,</hi> it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> but it <hi>gives</hi> no <hi>ſtrength,</hi> no <hi>grace.</hi> And therefore Divines have compared this <hi>rigour</hi> in the Law to the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who <hi>required</hi> the <hi>tale</hi> of bricke, but <hi>afforded</hi> no ſtraw; So the Law <hi>requires</hi> the full tale, it abates of nothing in the command, but it <hi>gives</hi> no aſſiſtance and concurrence for the doing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170645:40"/>of it; It anſwers us there as the Prieſts did <hi>Iudas, See thou to that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in the Goſpell wee are freed from impoſſibilities, here <hi>omnia poſſibilia,</hi> all things are poſſible, not in reſpect of us, but in reſpect of God, who hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>to work all our works in us;</hi>

               <hi>and for us; Chryſoſtome</hi> bleſſeth God, that <hi>that which God required of him, he had given to him.</hi> Indeed the workes of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> are as great as any workes of the <hi>Law,</hi> nay, greater, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> which is a greater worke then to <hi>doe</hi> all the duties of the Law; But God hath <hi>given</hi> us more <hi>ſtrength,</hi> we have <hi>Communion</hi> with the power and ſtrength of Chriſt.

               <note place="margin">Decalogus eſt lex ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualis, Evangelium lex Spiritus.</note> but yet they are eaſie in reſpect of <hi>divine coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> the Law was a ſpirituall Law, but the

<note place="margin">Decalogus eſt lex ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualis, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium lex ſpiritus.</note> and doth therefore inable to doe, what it commands to be done: take one inſtance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 12. the Spirit enjoynes that we ſhould <hi>not let ſinne reigne in our mortall bodies.</hi> There is the command, and reade the 14. verſe. <hi>Sinne ſhall have no domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in your mortall bodies.</hi> There is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and he alleadgeth this reaſon; for you are not under the Law, but under Grace: as if he had ſaid, had you been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law you could not have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch aſſiſtance, but you are under grace, and therefore ſhall have that power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This was the <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law, that the Law required obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>in our own perſons,</hi> it would not allow of any to doe or worke for us, nor any to help us in the doing of it, we are now freed from this rigour, and God will accept of our obedience by another.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>twofold debt</hi> we owed to God,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The debt</hi> of ſinne.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The debt</hi> of ſervice.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two, The debt of ſinne and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were both <hi>tranſacted</hi> upon Chriſt, and he hath fulfilled all righteouſneſſe, <hi>legis &amp; crucis,</hi> for us,
<note place="margin">2 Col. 10.</note> hence we are ſaid
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170645:41"/>
               <hi>to be compleat in Chriſt,</hi> though we be <hi>im perfect</hi> in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This was the <hi>rigor</hi> of the Law, that it required <hi>univerſall, actuall,</hi> as well as perſonall obedience, yea and with that rigor, that if you failed in one <hi>tittle,</hi> you were gone for ever, 3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 10. <hi>Curſed is he who obeyes not every thing written in the booke of the Law to dee it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

All your deſires, all your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would not ſerve the turne; if you failed in the leaſt tittle,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae locus in lege.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> you were gone for ever; no <hi>repentance,</hi> no teares, no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no <hi>future</hi> care would make it up. Though the Goſpell doe <hi>admit</hi> of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet the Law will not owne it. It looks for <hi>exact</hi> obedience to every tittle: From this rigid obedience hath God freed you. And God is pleaſed for <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall actuall,</hi> to accept of <hi>univerſall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> obedience. <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.6. <hi>Even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all his Commandements.</hi> Though there be failing in <hi>action,</hi> yet where there is truth of <hi>affection,</hi> God can owne it.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170645:41"/>In the Goſpell God accepteth of <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for <hi>actions,</hi> of <hi>endeavours</hi> for <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> of <hi>deſire</hi> for <hi>ability.</hi> Here is all, a Chriſtian he is made up of <hi>deſires,</hi> of <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> thirſtings and bewaylings. <hi>Oh that my wayes</hi> were directed; and <hi>oh miſerable man that</hi> I am! here is Goſpell perfection. <hi>Adams</hi> want was rather <hi>will</hi> then power, ours rather <hi>power</hi> then will; there is <hi>will</hi> to doe, but wants <hi>power</hi> to doe: Not that the <hi>will</hi> is perfect; for as we cannot <hi>doe</hi> the things we <hi>would</hi> doe, there is <hi>fleſh</hi> in our members: ſo we cannot <hi>will</hi> the things we <hi>ſhould</hi> will; there is <hi>fleſh</hi> in our wils: but yet I ſay, the fayling of Gods people is more for <hi>want</hi> of power then <hi>want</hi> of will; there is <hi>will</hi> to doe, but there wants <hi>power</hi> to doe, as the Apoſtle, <hi>To will is preſent with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>but how to performe that which is good I find not.</hi> And God hath mercy for <hi>can nots,</hi> but none for <hi>will nots:</hi> God can diſtinguiſh between <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> While thou art under the Law, this <hi>weakneſſe</hi> is thy wickedneſſe, a <hi>ſinfull weakneſſe,</hi> and therefore God hates it. Vnder the Goſpell he looks not upon the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> of ſaints as their wickedneſſe, and therefore he pitties them. Sinne makes thoſe who are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170645:42"/>under the Law the <hi>obiects</hi> of Gods <hi>hatred:</hi> Sin in a <hi>Beleever</hi> makes him the <hi>obiect</hi> of Gods pitty. Men you know <hi>hate poyſon</hi> in a toade, but <hi>pitty</hi> it in a man. In the one it is their <hi>nature,</hi> in the other their <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> Sin in a wicked man is as poyſon in a toad; God hates it and him, it's his nature; but ſin in a childe is like poyſon in a man; God pitties him, he pitties the Saints for ſinnes and infirmities, he hates the wicked. It's the ones nature, and the others diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This was againe the <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law, that it <hi>inforced</hi> it ſelfe upon the <hi>conſcience</hi> with <hi>threats</hi> and with <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> but now the Goſpell comes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, with beſeeches and love. <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, Rom.</hi> 12.1.

Not to <hi>uſurp</hi> Maſterſhip. 2. Not to <hi>undergoe</hi> ſervitude.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> not to <hi>uſurp</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip. You have it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8.9, 10. <hi>Be not ye called</hi> Rabbi; <hi>for one is your
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170645:43"/>Maſter even Chriſt, and all yee are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Neither be ye called maſters; for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for the ſecond, not to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe</hi> ſervitude, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not yee the ſervants of men:</hi> But the <hi>meaning</hi> is, that we are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any our <hi>ſupreame</hi> maſter, nor are we to give our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſciences,</hi> nor <hi>inthrall our iudgements</hi> to the <hi>ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> definitions, or determinations of any man, or men upon earth, becauſe this were to make men <hi>Maſters of our Faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo much abhorred, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>We are not maſters of your faith, but helpers of your ioy.</hi> There are <hi>two-fold maſters,</hi> 1. Maſters <hi>according</hi> to the fleſh, and 2. maſters <hi>according</hi> to the ſpirit. The firſt you read of in the 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Servants be obedient to your Maſters according to the fleſh;</hi> the ſecond we read of in that 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Wee are to be obedient to</hi> our maſters according to the fleſh, ſo farre as <hi>appertaines</hi> to the <hi>outward</hi> man in all <hi>outward</hi> things: But of our ſoules and <hi>conſciences,</hi> as wee have no <hi>fathers,</hi> ſo we have no <hi>maſters</hi> upon earth, onely our Maſter and Father which is in heaven, and in this ſenſe Chriſt ſpeakes, that we muſt not <hi>abſolutely</hi> yeeld up our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170645:44"/>ſelves to be ruled by the will of any, nor <hi>inthrall</hi> our indgements, and ſubmit our faith and conſciences to <hi>any</hi> power below Chriſt. It were high <hi>uſurpation</hi> for any to require it, it is to enter on Chriſts Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royall, and it is no leſſe iniquity for us to render it. And ſo much ſhall ſerve for the fourth branch, I may ſpeak more unto it, when we come to the query on it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, we are <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>death.</hi> There is a three-fold death. Firſt, A <hi>Spirituall</hi> death, the death of the <hi>ſoule</hi> in the body. Secondly, a <hi>naturall</hi> death, the death of the <hi>bodie</hi> from the ſoule. Thirdly, an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> death, the death of <hi>ſoule and body</hi> for ever. Two of theſe you do not doubt of, all the queſtion is about the third, <hi>viz.</hi> naturall death, of which I ſhall ſay no more but this, Firſt, that it is the body only dies, the worſer part, and our duſt and bones are ſtill united to the Son of God. Secondly, you are freed from death as a <hi>Curſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bonus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por in Ieſu. Sancti ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent vitam in patientia, mortem in defiderio.</note> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of death is taken away, and therefore the name is changed; it is but called a ſleep, and a ſleep in Chriſt, and a gathering to our fathers, a change, a departing. Death is the Godly mans <hi>wiſh,</hi> the wicked mans <hi>feare. Ariſtippus</hi> being demanded in a <hi>ſtorm</hi> why he <hi>feared</hi> not as well as others,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170645:44"/>hee anſwered, there is great odds, they feared the <hi>torments</hi> due to a <hi>bad life;</hi> but he <hi>expected</hi> the rewards due to a good life. Thirdly, this is another part of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from death, that wee ſhall not <hi>die</hi> till the <hi>beſt</hi> time. Indeed none ſhall die till Gods <hi>time,</hi> the wickedſt man in the world ſhall not die till Gods time. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid to his enemies, ſo may any man ſay, <hi>My times are in thy hands.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.15.</note> But this is not ever the beſt time: thou may die with <hi>Baltaſar</hi> carouſing, with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> lying, with the <hi>Nobleman</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving, with <hi>Iulian</hi> blaſpheming: But this is the <hi>priviledge</hi> of Saints, they ſhall not <hi>die</hi> till the <hi>beſt</hi> time, not till that time, when if they were but <hi>rightly</hi> informed they would deſire to dye.</p>
            <p>Men cut downe <hi>weeds</hi> at any time, but their <hi>corne</hi> they will not <hi>cut downe</hi> till the beſt time, <hi>you are Gods husbandry</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, you are his wheat, and when you are <hi>ripe,</hi> when you have done your worke, then, and not till then ſhall you be <hi>gathered</hi> into your Maſters Garner. So much for the fift.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, wee ſhall be freed from the <hi>Grave,</hi> and this comes under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate freedome. We will but touch

            <p>The <hi>ſame bodies</hi> ſhall ariſe, the <hi>ſame ſoule</hi> ſhall be united to the ſame individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body againe. And this is a myſterie, the Philoſophers dreamed of a <hi>transformation</hi> of bodies, or bodies transformed into new ſhapes, &amp; a <hi>tranſmigration</hi> of ſouls, or fouls ſlitting into new bodies, but could never apprehend the truth of this the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, that the ſame individuall numericall body after it is <hi>corrupted</hi> in the water, <hi>conſumed</hi> by fire, <hi>converted</hi> into earth, <hi>vaniſhed</hi> into aire, nay <hi>caton</hi> up by

When <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed this point at <hi>Athens,</hi> the great <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans laughed at him; <hi>What will this bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſay?</hi> they looked upon this as Babling; but the Scripture tells us, <hi>That we ſhall ſee him with theſe ſame eyes,</hi> Iob 19.27. And it ſuits with Gods juſtice, that the ſame bodies which have ſinned or ſuffered, ſhall be puniſhed, or rewarded.</p>
            <p>The ſoule and body ſhall never be <hi>parted</hi> more to all Eternitie. When you die,
<label type="milestone">

            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>Privitive</hi> part of our freedome, what we are freed from.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now ſpeak ſomething to the <hi>Poſitive</hi> part of it, what we are free unto. I will but name a few particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we are freed from a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> to a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> and favour.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> you are freed from a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> to a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> before you were under the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, becauſe you had ſinned, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170645:46"/>of the Goſpel becauſe you beleeved not.

            <p>Thirdly, you are freed from a ſtate of <hi>enmity,</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>friendſhip And you that were enemies hath God reconciled,</hi> Col 1.21.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you are freed from a ſtate of <hi>death</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>life. You that were dead in your treſpaſſes and ſinnes hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Ephe. 2. begin.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, you are freed from a ſtate of <hi>ſin,</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>ſervice. Hee hath redeemed us from our enemies, that we might ſerve him.</hi> Luke 1.34. Therefore did God diſcharge <hi>the debt of ſin,</hi> that we might render him <hi>the debt of ſervice;</hi> hee freed us from the <hi>bonds</hi> of miſery, that we might take on us the <hi>ingagements</hi> of dutie. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. The Apoſtle inferres this after all the benefits
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170645:46"/>expeſſed by Chriſt; <hi>Therefore brethren we are debters.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tibi ſervire eſt regnare.</note> And he that thinks not ſervice his freedome, thinks not ſin his bondage, and therefore is in bondage.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, you are freed from a ſtate of <hi>Bondage,</hi> a ſpirit of ſlavery in ſervice, to a ſpirit of <hi>ſon-ſhip</hi> and libertie in ſervice: as by his blood he redeemed us from being ſlaves; ſo by his Obedience and Spirit hee hath redeemed us to be ſonnes. Now you are drawne to ſervice, not with <hi>cords</hi> of feare, but with the <hi>bands</hi> of love; not out of <hi>compulſions</hi> of conſcience, but <hi>propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Nature. As the <hi>love of God</hi> to us was the <hi>Spring</hi> of all his actions to us, ſo our love to God is the <hi>riſe</hi> of all our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In a word, for wee cannot ſtand to name all, you are freed from <hi>death and hell,</hi> to <hi>life and glory;</hi> heaven is your <hi>Portion,</hi> your <hi>Inheritance,</hi> your <hi>Manſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</hi> It was <hi>made</hi> for you, and you for it; it was <hi>prepared</hi> for you, and you for it; you <hi>are veſſells prepared for glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23, And this is called the <hi>glorious liberty of the ſons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. Epheſ. 1.14. And to tell you what you are freed from, and what you ſhall injoy hereafter; for to take
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170645:47"/>you to the top of <hi>Nebo,</hi> and ſhew you all this <hi>Canaan,</hi> would make you willing to lay downe your bodies there, and go up to injoy it. I ſay, to open this priviledge alittle, which yet is farre above man to do. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive what God hath reſerved for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9.</note> and yet that is ſpoken of Grace, and therefore what is Glory? Could we but open this to you, it were even enough to put you into heaven, while you are here upon earth. It is called the new Ieruſalem, glory, joy, Maſters joy, Fathers houſe, Kingdome, Kingdome of glory, Heaven, Light, Life, Eternall life. Look but on that one place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>For our light afflictions which are but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> It is one of the nereſt expreſſions we read of. 1. Glory, 2. Weight of glory, 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of glory, 4. More ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of glory. 5. A far more exceeding weight of glory, 6. Nay, a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory, and this is the glorious liberty of the ſons of God: But we muſt ſhut up this, becauſe I would not willingly keepe you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170645:47"/>off, from that which is the chief I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thus have we as <hi>briefly,</hi> as the largenes and concernment of the ſubject would ſuffer us, finiſhed thoſe three Generals which we propoſed in the handling of this Doctrine: I ſhould now come to <hi>the application</hi> of what I have ſaid, and the largeneſſe of the ſubject would afford much for comfort &amp; for caution: for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and incouragement to the people of God. But I have other worke to doe firſt.</p>
            <p>This Text is the maine <hi>Baſis</hi> whereon this Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian freedome</hi> is built: and in regard many have ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>build</hi> their owne ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, hay and ſtubble on it, which the <hi>foundation</hi> will never beare; I ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there are ſo many Opinions which plead <hi>patronage</hi> from this Doctrine, I conceive it is my great worke to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> ſo excellent a Doctrine as this is of <hi>Chriſtian freedome,</hi> from thoſe falſe, I may ſay, <hi>licentions</hi> doctrines which are faſtened and fathered on it: And to ſhew you that neither this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor yet this <hi>Text,</hi> will afford <hi>countenance,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any <hi>ſtrength</hi> to ſuch <hi>poſitions,</hi> and

            <p>The worke is great, for I am to deale with the greateſt <hi>knots</hi> in the <hi>practicall</hi> part of Divinitie, and mens <hi>iudgements</hi> are various, <hi>Scripture</hi> is pleaded on all hands: The more difficult the worke, the more need of your prayers, that the <hi>Father</hi> of light, would goe before us, and by his owne light leade and guide us <hi>into the waies of all truth</hi>

            <p>And ſo much might <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for the clearing of the firſt Argument: Nay the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>poſition</hi> it ſelfe, if our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170645:59"/>
               <hi>adverſaries</hi> would be ſatisfied. We will heare what they can ſay therefore, and anſwer it; and then proceed to the reſt of the Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Some ſay, Though it be a rule, yet it is a rule at our libertie whether we will obey it or no: It is not a binding rule.</p>
            <p>And there are three ſeverall Opinions of this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſay, That it bindes us no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then as we are <hi>creatures,</hi> not as we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but as we are <hi>creatures:</hi> But why then are not they bound? I hope they are creatures as well as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others ſay, It doth binde the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but not the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> it doth bind the <hi>nure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> part, but not the <hi>regenerate</hi> to obedience, for that is free: and here is a dangerous Gap opened to all licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: witneſſe the Opinions of <hi>David George,</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Others ſay, That it is not a <hi>binding</hi> rule at all; beleevers are no more under the Law, then <hi>England</hi> under the Laws of <hi>Spaine:</hi> nor no more bound to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Law, then any man is bound to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Lawes of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170645:60"/>another Common-wealth: this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws, ſay they, Chriſtian libertie.</p>
            <p>Now if this be true, it ſtrikes downe all: if it be a <hi>rule,</hi> but not a <hi>binding</hi> rule; a rule binding to obedience, it will be of ſmall uſe.

            <p>That which doth cauſe the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of regenerate men to <hi>Excuſe,</hi>

            <p>That which hath <hi>power</hi> to ſay to the conſcience of the regenerate Chriſtian,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>2</label> This <hi>ought</hi> to be done, and that <hi>ought</hi> not to be done, doth bind the conſcience: but

            <p>That Authoritie by which the Apoſtles urged Chriſtians to dutie,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>3</label> doth bind the conſcience to obedience. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did uſe the authoritie of the Law to provoke Chriſtians to do their dutie, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> For this look <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right; honour your father and mother, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Law of God doe not <hi>bind</hi> the conſcience of a regenerate man to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

            </p>
            <p>Either the Law doth bind the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of Chriſtians to obedience;

            <p>Or take it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Chriſtians be bound not to ſinne,</hi> then they are bound to keepe the Law: but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are <hi>bound</hi> not to ſinne: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>If he that breaks the law doth ſinne,

<label type="milestone">

            <p>If the ſame duties which were <hi>enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the law,
<label type="milestone">

They tell us we make a falſe mixture together of Chriſt and Moſes, and wee mingle Law and Goſpel together. How unjuſtly this charge is caſt upon us, let underſtanding men judge. We <hi>cry downe</hi> the Law in point of juſtification;
<note place="margin">Abſit ut ego tibi aſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, qui dicis legem iis eſſe mortua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maxime vivit.

What ever they ſay of the Law, though they caſt contempt and diſgrace on it, and upon thoſe which preach it; yet you ſee for the ſubſtance of it, it is the <hi>image</hi> of God, a <hi>beame</hi> of his holines, the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170645:65"/>things commanded and forbidden, are things <hi>Morally,</hi> and therefore <hi>Eternally</hi> good and evill, nothing can alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them. Things <hi>poſitively</hi> good or evill,
<note place="margin">Lex eſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiſſima et abſolutiſſima regula juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae moralis, cui nihil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, nihil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahi poteſt.

That which was <hi>Morally</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill then, is Morally evill now, and to be ſhunned and avoided. Wee have a Goſpel rule which turnes us to the obedience of the Law. You ſhall ſee the rule, Phillippians 4.8. <hi>What ever things are true, what ever things are honeſt, what ever things are iuſt, what ever things are pure, what ever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report: If there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, thinke of theſe things.</hi> And I hope the Law is of this number, the Apoſtle tells us that the Law is holy, juſt and good, certainly there is nothing commanded but what is good: if weare to learne of the Ant, the Piſmire, of brute beaſts, of inanimate things, certainly much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170645:66"/>more are we to learne of the Law, which is the image of God in man, and the will of God to man. We have nothing to doe with <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor doe we look to <hi>Sinai</hi> the <hi>hill</hi> of bondage, but to <hi>Sion</hi> the <hi>mountaine</hi> of grace; and we take the Law as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>rule</hi> of Gods will, and deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelves to it, and breath out with David,

               <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy Statutes!</hi> Certainly the Law and Goſpel doe <hi>help</hi> one another, they <hi>lend</hi> one another the hand.</p>
            <p>The Law that is <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the Goſpel, to convince and humble us, and the Goſpel that <hi>inables</hi> to the the obedience of the Law. The Law <hi>ſends</hi> us to the Goſpel for our juſtification, the Goſpel <hi>ſends</hi> us to the Law to <hi>frame</hi> our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and our obedience to the Law is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the expreſſion of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to that God, who hath ſo freely juſtified us, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1.74. <hi>That being redeemed, we might ſerve him without feare.</hi> Though our ſervice was not the <hi>motive</hi> or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe of Gods redeeming of us, yet it is the end of our redemption, the Apoſtle ſhews at large in the ſixt to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And it is the <hi>Application</hi> he makes of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of free Iuſtification, the 8. <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:170645:66"/>12. <hi>Therefore brethren we are debters,</hi> if Chriſt hath <hi>freed</hi> you from the <hi>penalties,</hi> how ought you to <hi>ſubiect</hi> your ſelves to the <hi>precepts?</hi> if he have <hi>delivered</hi> you from the curſes, how ought you to <hi>ſtudy</hi> the commands? if he <hi>paid</hi> our debt of ſin, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we <hi>owe</hi> a debt of ſervice.</p>

            <p>The principles of obedience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> before they were <hi>legall</hi> and ſervile, now they are <hi>filiall</hi> and Evangelicall.

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14</note> yet is the obedience free. Love knowes no difficulties; things

            <p>It agrees thus farre with Scripture, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of the law, he gave the law, and he is often taken for the law; <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> Luk. 16.29. <hi>And there is one that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you, even Moſes in whom you truſt, Ioh.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was a type of Chriſt; his name ſignifies ſo much: he was <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſo called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. <hi>If Ieſus,</hi> that is, <hi>Ioſhua, could have given them reſt: Moſes</hi> muſt <hi>lead</hi> the children of Iſrael through the <hi>wilderneſſe;</hi> but <hi>Ioſhua</hi> muſt bring them into <hi>Canaan.</hi> So while you are in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170645:69"/>
               <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> of this world, you muſt walke under the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> you muſt live in <hi>obedience</hi> to the law, but it is not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> not <hi>works,</hi> but <hi>faith;</hi> not <hi>obedience,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt bring you into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Doe what you can while you <hi>live;</hi> but be ſure to <hi>die</hi> upon Chriſts ſcore.</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſerve for the firſt Poſition; <hi>That the ſubſtance of the law is a rule of obedience to the people of God, and that to which they are to conforme their lives and walkings,</hi> now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>And this we have proved by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by a cloud of witneſſes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant teſtimony of ſome, and might of all the Reformed Churches: we have ſtrengthened this by many Arguments, and given you ſome Applications of it.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the ſecond Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which we laid downe in Anſwer to the Query which will be more knotty; but if we ſhall be able to make it good, it will at once <hi>vindicate</hi> the Law, and ſtrike downe thoſe many <hi>erroneous</hi> Opinions that are on foot againſt it.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, as a <hi>reſtrainer</hi> and corrector of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as a <hi>reprover</hi> of ſinne, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>I ſhall for the preſent but lay downe the principle and maine ends, for which the law was promulged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>reſtraine</hi> tranſgreſſion; to ſet <hi>bounds</hi> and banks to the curſed nature of man fallen; not onely by diſcovering ſin, but the wrath of God; <hi>tribulation and anguiſh to every ſoule who doth evill,</hi> Rom. 2.8, 9. We read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That the law was added becauſe of tranſgreſsion.</hi> And this place <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> underſtand of the reſtraint of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The law may <hi>reſtraine</hi> ſinners, though it cannot <hi>renew</hi> ſinners; it may <hi>cohibit</hi> and bridle ſinne, though it cannot <hi>heale</hi> and cure it. Before God gave the law ſinne had a more perfect reigne; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170645:71"/>of the <hi>darkeneſſe</hi> of mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſecuritie of their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>Death reigned, and ſo ſinne from Adam to Moſes.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſheweth. And therefore God might give the law to <hi>diſcover,</hi> not onely that they <hi>ſinned</hi> in ſuch courſes wherein they walked; but to <hi>diſcover</hi> to them alſo that heavie <hi>wrath</hi> of God which they <hi>drew</hi> upon themſelves by ſinne, which might worke ſo farre as to <hi>reſtraine</hi> men in the courſe of ſinne; and to hinder ſinne that it could not now have ſo compleat, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled a <hi>dominion</hi> and reign in the ſoule. Though it did ſtill reign, for <hi>reſtraining</hi> grace doth not <hi>conquer,</hi> though it doth <hi>ſuppreſſe</hi> and keepe downe ſinne; yet it ſhould not have ſo <hi>full,</hi> ſo compleat, ſo uncontrolled a dominion in the ſoule: the <hi>ſinner</hi> ſhould be in feare, and that will ſerve to <hi>reſtraine</hi> men in wayes of ſinne, though not to <hi>renew</hi> the ſinner.</p>
            <p>If God had not given a <hi>ſevere</hi> and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>law</hi> againſt ſinne, ſuch is the <hi>vileneſſe</hi> of mens ſpirits, they would have <hi>acted</hi> all villany: the <hi>Devill</hi> would not onely have <hi>reigned,</hi> but <hi>raged</hi> in all the ſonnes of men. And therefore as we doe with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170645:72"/>
               <hi>madde</hi> Beaſts, Wolves, or Lions, &amp;c. we bind them up in chaines, that they may not doe that miſchiefe, which their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> carry them to: ſo the law <hi>chaines</hi> up the wickedneſſe of the hearts of men, that they dare not <hi>fulfill</hi> thoſe luſtfull inclinations which are in their hearts to doe.</p>
            <p>And bleſſed be God that there is this <hi>feare</hi> upon the ſpirits of wicked men; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there were no living in the world; one man would be a <hi>devil</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; every man would be a <hi>Cain</hi> to his brother, an <hi>Ammon</hi> to his ſiſter, an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> to his father, a <hi>Saul</hi> to himſelfe, a <hi>Iudas</hi> to his maſter: for what <hi>one</hi> man doth, <hi>all</hi> men would doe, were it not for reſtraint upon their ſpirits. Naturally, <hi>ſinne</hi> is paſt both <hi>ſenſe</hi> and ſhame too: there would be no whoe, no ſtay, no banke or bounds to ſinne; every man would be as a <hi>devil</hi> to another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have <hi>cauſe</hi> to bleſſe God, that he hath given a law to <hi>reſtraine</hi> tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that if men will not be ſo good as they ſhould be, yet they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and not be ſo <hi>bad</hi> as they would be. Were it not for this, and that <hi>awe</hi> that God hath caſt upon the ſpirits of wicked
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170645:72"/>men by it, there would be no ſafetie; the fields, the ſtreets, your houſes, your beds, would have beene <hi>filled</hi> with bloud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, murder, tapes, inceſts, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and all miſchiefes. If therefore no law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not murder;</hi> men would make every <hi>paſsion</hi> a ſtabbe: if no law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale;</hi> men would think <hi>theft,</hi> couſenage, cheating oppreſſion, good <hi>policy,</hi> &amp;c. and the beſt life <hi>ex rapto vivere,</hi> to live on other mens ſweat: if no law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery;</hi> men would defile their neighbours bed, and commit all wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore hath God given a law to ſet <hi>bounds</hi> and banks to defend us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>incurſions,</hi> and breaches that ſinne would make upon us. He that ſets <hi>bounds</hi> and bankes to the <hi>raging Sea,</hi> which otherwiſe would <hi>overflow</hi> the Land, doth ſet alſo bounds and bankes to mens ſins, and ſinfull affections.</p>
            <p>It is no leſſe wonder that the <hi>deluge</hi> of luſt and corruption in men, doth not break forth to the <hi>overflowing</hi> of all banks, then that the <hi>Sea</hi> doth not breake forth upon us, but he that ſets <hi>bounds</hi> to the one, doth alſo <hi>bound</hi> and reſtraine the other. That's the firſt end.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:170645:73"/>
            <p>Secondly, The Law was given to <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> &amp; reveal tranſgreſſions, and that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is the proper meaning of that place, <hi>Gal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Beza. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi>
               </note> 3.19. <hi>The Law it was added, becauſe of tranſgreſſions,</hi> that is chiefly, that the Law might be <hi>inſtar ſpeculi,</hi> like to a glaſſe to reveale and diſcover ſinne, and ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Is the Law ſinne? God forbid. Nay, ſayes he, I had not known ſinne but by the Law, for I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> And this the Apoſtle ſeemes to ſpeak alſo, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that the offence might abound,</hi> that is, that ſinne might appeare <hi>exceeding</hi> ſinfull.</p>
            <p>This is another end, God gave the Law, to <hi>open,</hi> reveale and <hi>convince</hi> the ſoule of ſinne. And this was with reference to the <hi>promiſe</hi> to grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>And therefore God gave the Law <hi>after</hi> the promiſe,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex morbum manifeſtat, evangelium medicum monſtrat.</hi> Alſt.</note> to diſcover ſinne and to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken</hi> the conſcience, and to drive men out of themſelves, and <hi>bring</hi> them over to Chriſt. Before he gave the Law, men were <hi>ſecure</hi> and careleſſe, did not eſteeme of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and the ſalvation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe offered; they ſaw not that <hi>neceſſitie</hi> of it. And therefore God gave the Law to <hi>diſcover</hi> ſinne, and by that our <hi>need</hi> of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170645:73"/>the promiſe, that ſo the promiſe and Grace might be advanced. God in giving the Law did but <hi>purſue</hi> the purpoſe of mercie he had in giving the promiſe, by taking a courſe to make his Goſpel <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation,</hi> that when we were convinced of ſinne, we might <hi>looke</hi> out for, and <hi>prize</hi> a Saviour; when we were <hi>ſtung</hi> with the fiery Serpent, we might looke up to the <hi>brazen</hi> Serpent — and in this God did but purſue the <hi>deſigne</hi> of his own grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Law was given to <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> men for ſin, and this is a fruit of the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Now we know what ever thing the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the world might become guiltie,</hi> that is, ſenſible of their own guilt, for we were no leſſe guiltie before, but now by the Law men are made <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of their own guilt, for ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſinne,</hi>

               <hi>imputed where there is no Law, nevertheleſſe, death reigned from Adam to Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is, there was no leſſe ſinne, or guilt and death before the Law then after, ſinne reigned, and death reigned over all the ſonnes of men, and it <hi>reigned</hi> the more, becauſe it <hi>reigned</hi> in the darke, there was no Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whereby to diſcover and reveale it to them, and to help to charge ſin upon them. And ſo he ſaith;
<note place="margin">Cum aperte proponeretur lex, clarum fuit pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, cum ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum minus compunxit conſcientiam.

               <hi>Sinne is not imputed where there is no Law,</hi> that is, though ſinne and death did reigne, yet men were <hi>ſecure</hi> and careleſſe, and having no Law to <hi>diſcover</hi> ſinne to them, they did not <hi>charge</hi> their hearts with ſinne, they did not impute ſin to themſelves. And therefore God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi> the Law, and promulged the Law in <hi>Mount</hi> Sinai, to diſcover and impute ſinne to men, to charge them with ſinne. I will give it you in this ſimilitude. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Debtor</hi> to owe a great ſumme of money to a <hi>Creditor,</hi> and the Creditor out of meere mercy ſhould <hi>promiſe</hi> him to <hi>forgive</hi> him all the debt, yet after this ſhould ſend forth <hi>Officers</hi> to <hi>Attach</hi> and <hi>Arreſt</hi> him, one would thinke ſurely this
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170645:74"/>man is <hi>contrary</hi> to himſelfe, he hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> of his former promiſes, when yet he is the <hi>ſame</hi> and repents of nothing, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires that his <hi>mercy</hi> might be more conſpicuous and advanced in the thoughts of the Debtor, and therefore ſuffers him to be brought to theſe extremities, that mercy might more clearely appeare, that he may be more thankfull. The caſe is the ſame between God and us, We are deeply <hi>indebted</hi> unto God; And to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and us in him, God made a <hi>promiſe</hi> of mercy, but men were <hi>ſecure</hi> and careleſſe, and though they were guiltie of ſinne, and ſo lyable to death, yet being without a Law to <hi>evidence</hi> ſinne and death to their conſciences, they could not ſee it ſuch a mercy as it was to have a pardon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon God <hi>publiſhed</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a ſevere and terrible Law, to diſcover, accuſe us, and condemn us for ſinne, not that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the <hi>ſentence</hi> ſhould take hold, for then God ſhould be <hi>contrary</hi> to himſelfe; but that hereby <hi>guilt</hi> being made evident, our mouthes ſtopped, we might fall down and acknowledg the greatneſſe and riches of free grace and mercy. And thus it was in <hi>Iob:</hi> as you ſee fully in <hi>Iob</hi> 33.16. to the 31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170645:75"/>all under ſinne, that the promiſe by faith, &amp;c. might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The Law was given for a <hi>direction</hi> of life, a rule of walking to beleevers. And this I ſhewed you at large in the former Poſition, That the law was a <hi>rule</hi> of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

And this is a truth as cleare as the light, and ſurely to be free from obedience, is to be ſervants unto ſin, as I have ſhewed at large.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The Law was given not onely as a <hi>Director</hi> for duties, but as a <hi>glaſſe</hi> to diſcover the imperfections of them, that ſo we might be <hi>Kept humble</hi> and vile in our owne eyes, and that wee might live more <hi>out</hi> of our ſelves, and more in Chriſt, that we might <hi>flie</hi> to Chriſt upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as a defiled man to the fountaine, to be waſhed and cleanſed, in whom there is

<note place="margin">Lexdocendo, admonendo, objurgando corrigendo ad omne bonum opus nos for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.

            <p>Seventhly, The Law was given to be a <hi>ſpurre</hi> to quicken us to duties; The fleſh is ſluggiſh, and the Law is <hi>inſtar ſtimuli,</hi> of the nature of a <hi>ſpur,</hi> or goad to quicken us in the wayes of obedience.

            <p n="2">2. I am now to ſhew you that there was no end wherefore the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but might <hi>conſiſt</hi> with Grace, and be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the <hi>Covenant of Grace, and therefore may remaine under Grace.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. It was given to reſtraine tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and it is of the ſame uſe now; and takes place to <hi>reſtraine</hi> wicked men in ſin, though it have no power to <hi>renew</hi> and change them; <hi>feare</hi> may reſtraine, though it cannot renue men; <hi>feare</hi> may ſuppreſſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170645:76"/>ſin, though alone <hi>Faith</hi> doth conquer and overcome ſin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Law may <hi>chaine</hi> up the Wolfe, but the Goſpel <hi>changeth</hi> the Wolviſh nature, the one <hi>ſtoppes</hi> the ſtreame, the other <hi>heales</hi> the fountaine; the one reſtrains the practiſes, the other <hi>renewes</hi> the principles. And who doth not ſee this the <hi>ordinarie</hi> fruit of the Law of God now? It was the ſpeech of a holy man, That our <hi>Caine</hi> hath not killed his brother <hi>Abel;</hi> that our <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> hath not defloured his ſiſter <hi>Tamar;</hi> that our <hi>Reuben</hi> hath not gone up to his fathers couch; that our <hi>Abſolon</hi> hath not conſpired the death of his father. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God reſtrains them, therefore was the law <hi>added,</hi> and therefore for this uſe it <hi>continues,</hi> to <hi>reſtraine</hi> wicked men, to ſet bounds and bankes to the <hi>rage</hi> of mens luſtfull hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170645:77"/>it concluds us under ſinne: that is, it doth humble us, convince us of ſin, that ſo the promiſe might be given: and hence it is ſaid in the 24. verſe,
<note place="margin">Lege pareum in locum.</note> 
               <hi>The law is our Schoole-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt;</hi> he ſpeakes of the ſame law of which he did before, which ſeemes by the 22. verſe, to be the Morall law: and how is this the Schoole-maſter, but by laſhing us, humbling us for ſinne, and driving us to Chriſt? Or admit that it were the <hi>ceremoniall</hi> law which were ſaid to be the Schoole-maſter; yet the <hi>Morall</hi> law was the rod: the Maſter doth little without the <hi>rod,</hi> nor the Ceremony except the Morall law did drive them to the Ceremoniall, which was then Chriſt in figure, as it doth now drive us to Chriſt in truth.</p>
            <p>And thus the Law ſtill remaines, as an inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit to diſcover ſinne to us, and humble us for it, that ſo we might come over to Chriſt. If the <hi>avenger</hi> of bloud had not followed the <hi>murderer,</hi> he would never have gone to the <hi>Citie</hi> of refuge: if God ſhould not humble us, we ſhould never go to Chriſt. A tender of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and pardon before men bee <hi>humbled,</hi> is worth nothing.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170645:78"/>Men doe by this as thoſe who were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited</hi> to the Supper; <hi>they made light of it:</hi> ſo they make <hi>light</hi> of a pardon, of the bloud of Chriſt; but when once God hath <hi>diſcovered</hi> ſin; when the law hath come upon us as on <hi>Paul,</hi> with an accuſing, convincing, humbling, killing power: Oh then <hi>Chriſt</hi> is precious, the <hi>promiſe</hi> precious, the <hi>bloud</hi> of Chriſt precious. And I conceive this was the maine end God gave the Law after the promiſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the promiſe.

            <p n="4">4. The law was given for a <hi>direction</hi> of life, and ſo it doth ſtill remaine; as I have fully proved to you.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The law, ſay ſome of our Divines, was given with <hi>Evangelicall purpoſes,</hi> that is, with purpoſes ſubſervient to the Goſpel; and I ſay, it muſt be obeyed with <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall principles;</hi> principles from Chriſt.

               <hi>without</hi> us; it cannot make us holy, it muſt be a rule <hi>within</hi> us.</p>
            <p>The law is a <hi>principle</hi> within us firſt, and then a <hi>patterne</hi> without us: we are not made holy by <hi>imitation,</hi> but by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation.</hi> But that principle within <hi>ſends</hi> you thither as to the rule without; after which you ſhould conforme your lives without: when the law is once your <hi>principle,</hi> it then becomes your <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It was given us as a <hi>glaſſe</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our imperfections of dutie, and that remaines; there you ſee the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your duties, of your graces, &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and by that you are kept cloſe to Chriſt; you are kept humble: this caſts you out of your ſelves, and caſts you upon the hold of Chriſt and the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>And thus in briefe you have ſeene two of theſe things propounded, done; you have ſeene the maine ends and uſes for which the law was ſet up: you have ſeen how theſe <hi>ends</hi> were not onely <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with Grace, but might be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the <hi>advancement</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the third thing propounded, to anſwer Objections; and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170645:79"/>then we will ſhut up this firſt and maine Query with ſome Application.</p>
            <p>We are now to deale with the third thing, the anſwering of Objections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Obiect.</hi> We read that the Law was ſet up as a Covenant, and in that uſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it could not <hi>ſtand</hi> with Grace, and therefore there were <hi>ſome ends</hi> and uſes wherefore the law was given that are not <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with Grace.</p>
            <p>Now that it was ſet up as a Covenant, theſe places ſeeme to declare, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4.6. <hi>Now therefore if you will obey my voyce indeed, and keepe my Covenant, then you ſhall be a peculiar people;</hi> — But yet more plainly in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And the Lord declared to you his Covenant, which he commanded you to performe, even tenne Commandements; and he wrote them upon two Tables of ſtone.</hi> Ier. 31.31, 32. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the dayes come,</hi> ſaith <hi>the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Iudah. Not according to the Covenant I made with their fathers in the day that I tooke them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. But this ſhall be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: I will put my laws into their hearts.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. <hi>For if the firſt Covenant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170645:80"/>had beene faultleſſe; then had there beene no place for another.</hi> Theſe places ſeeme to ſpeake very plainly, that the law was given as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of workes to the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And as a Covenant of workes it could not <hi>conſiſt</hi> with Grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were ſome ends wherefore the law was ſet up, which were not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with Grace.</p>
            <p>Now then for the <hi>clearing</hi> of theſe places, there hath beene laid downe by Divines divers <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of Covenants. Some have ſet downe theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Covenant of Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A mixt Covenant conſiſting of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Grace.</p>
            <p>Others ſet downe theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Foedus naturae.</hi> The Covenant of nature: or, that Covenant which God made with man in Innocency.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Foedus promiſſi:</hi> or the Covenant of the promiſe, as ſome; the Covenant of grace, as others; which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, in thoſe words; <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall breake the Serpents head,</hi> and renewed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 15. of <hi>Gen.</hi> but more clearely in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170645:80"/>earth be bleſſed.</hi> And this is the ſame in ſubſtance with the Covenant of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Foedus operis.</hi> The Covenant of works which was made with the Iews, as they interpret thoſe places, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p>Others againe, that make theſe three Covenants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Foedus naturae.</hi> The Covenant of nature made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Foedus gratiae.</hi> The Covenant of grace made to us in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Foedus ſubſerviens.</hi> Or the <hi>ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> Covenant, which they ſay, was the Covenant made here to the Iews, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in way of ſubſerviencie to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in Chriſt. A <hi>preparing</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to make way for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt: which as a Covenant is gone, though the ſubſerviencie of it doth ſtill remaine.</p>
            <p>Others there are that ſay, There were never any but <hi>two Covenants</hi> made with man: one of <hi>Workes,</hi> the other of <hi>Grace.</hi> The firſt in innocency, the other after the fall. But yet this Covenant of grace was ſo <hi>legally</hi> diſpenſed to the Iews, that it ſeems to be nothing elſe but the <hi>repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170645:81"/>of the Covenant of workes. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which <hi>legal diſpenſations</hi> of it, the ſame Covenant under the law is called a <hi>covenant</hi> of Works; under the Goſpel, in regard of the <hi>clearer manifeſtations</hi> of it, it is called a <hi>covenant</hi> of grace; but theſe were not two <hi>diſtinct</hi> covenants, but one and the ſame covenant diverſly diſpenſed. And that the law could not be a covenant of works properly taken; I will give but theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p>That I conceive cannot be ſaid to be a covenant of works whereby a <hi>holy</hi> God is <hi>married</hi> to a <hi>ſinfull</hi> people;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>1</label> but by this covenant, God was married to ſuch, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31, 32. And therefore could not be a covenant of workes.</p>
            <p>That can never be ſaid to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>2</label> which had <hi>mercy</hi> in it to ſinfull men, but this had: it was ſet up with <hi>mercifull</hi> purpoſes, with <hi>ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie</hi> to the Goſpel, as the Apoſtle ſhews at large in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the law were given as a covenant of workes,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>3</label> then were it <hi>oppoſite,</hi> and contrary to the promiſe; but that the Apoſtle ſhews it is not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Is the law againſt the promiſe? God forbid.</hi> But if it were ſet up as a covenant of workes,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170645:81"/>then were it diametrically oppoſite to it; for if of works, then not of grace.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That can never be a covenant of works which was <hi>added</hi> to the covenant of grace:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>4</label> but the Apoſtle ſhews the law was <hi>added</hi> to the promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. Now if it had beene <hi>added</hi> as a Covenant, then it would <hi>overthrow</hi> the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; it was ſo added, as that the nature of the promiſe might be preſerved: but if any thing of works were here, it would cleane overturne grace, and overthrow the nature of the promiſe. Therefore it was not added as a covenant, nor was it added by way of <hi>ingrediencie</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; as if we had beene to be juſtified <hi>partly</hi> by <hi>working, partly</hi> by <hi>beleeving;</hi> for that <hi>overthrowes</hi> the freeneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>If of workes, then it is not of grace.</hi> But it was added by way of <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to the promiſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith here <hi>it was added becauſe of tranſgreſsion.</hi> It was ſo added to the promiſe, or covenant of grace as to helpe and advance, not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and deſtroy it. And therefore could not be added as a covenant of works.</p>
            <p>The fifth Argument may be taken from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>5</label> where the Apoſtle ſhews <hi>that the law which was foure hundred and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170645:82"/>thirty yeares after the promiſe, could not diſanull or make the promiſe of none effect.</hi> But if God had ſet up the law as a <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> it would have <hi>diſanulled</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; nay and it would have <hi>declared</hi> God changeable, which cannot be; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>God is one;</hi> he is the <hi>ſame</hi> in his grace and purpoſe to ſinners, though he ſeeme by giving the law after the promiſe, to <hi>repent</hi> of his former mercy, and by this to cancell, or repeale what he had done: yet it is no ſuch matter, God <hi>is one,</hi> he is the ſame in all. This <hi>covenant</hi> was eſtabliſhed by oath,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18. Pſal. 110.4.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. And when God <hi>ſweares,</hi> he cannot repent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. Now if God ſet up this as a Covenant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given the promiſe; either this would have ſhewed <hi>mutability</hi> in Gods will, or <hi>contradiction</hi> in his acts, which cannot be. And therefore it could not be a covenant of workes.</p>
            <p>If it were Gods <hi>purpoſe</hi> to give <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> to the loſt ſonnes of men by a covenant of Grace,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>6</label> then he never ſet up the law as a covenant of works for that end. But this was his purpoſe, &amp;c. as the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance be by the law, then it is not by the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170645:82"/>promiſe; but God gave it to Abraham by promiſe, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Gods end to give life by the law, for he had given it before <hi>another</hi> way, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by promiſe. And therefore never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this the way.</p>
            <p>If the law were a covenant of <hi>workes,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>7</label> then were the Iews under a <hi>different</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant from us, and ſo none were ſaved, which the Apoſtle gain-ſaies, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11. <hi>We beleeve through the grace of Chriſt to be ſaved,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God never <hi>appointed</hi> any thing to an <hi>End,</hi>

And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>If there had beene a law given that could have given life,</hi> which implies it could not doe it, and therefore God never ſet it up for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It could never ſuit with Gods <hi>heart</hi> to ſinners to give a covenant of works after the fall; becauſe man could doe <hi>nothing,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Covenant of <hi>Nature,</hi> and that was whereby God <hi>required</hi> as the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of a creature, perfect <hi>obedience</hi> to all his Commandements, with promiſe of a bleſſed <hi>life</hi> in Paradiſe if he obeyed, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eternall <hi>death</hi> if he diſobeyed the command, and to this end, to declare how <hi>vertue</hi> pleaſed, and <hi>ſinne</hi> diſpleaſed him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby he promiſeth <hi>pardon</hi> and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and eternall life, by the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, to all thoſe that ſhould <hi>embrace</hi> him, and this to declare the <hi>riches</hi> of his mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Subſervient</hi> Covenant, which is called the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> whereby God did <hi>require</hi> obedience of the Iſraelites, to the Morall, Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall Lawes, upon promiſe of all bleſſings in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170645:85"/>the <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of Canaan, and threatning curſes and miſeries to them that did break it, and this to this end, that he might <hi>raiſe up</hi> their hearts, to the <hi>expectation</hi> of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> to come.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>ſubſervient</hi> Covenant, or old Covenant, is that which God did <hi>ſtrike</hi> with the people of Iſrael in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> to <hi>prepare</hi> them to faith, and to <hi>inflame</hi> them with the deſire of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the coming of Chriſt, and to be as it were a <hi>bridle</hi> of reſtraint, to <hi>cohibit</hi> them from ſinne, till that time that he ſhould ſend the Spirit of Adoption into their hearts, and <hi>governe</hi> them with a more free ſpirit.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Covenant,</hi> of which the Moral Law is ſaid to be a part, and which is called here the ſubſervient Covenant under vvhich the Ievvs vvere, is ſhevved at large (by the Author named) to be a third and <hi>diſtinct</hi> Covenant, betvveen the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature, and the Covenant of Grace. And vvho ever vvill have recourſe unto that <hi>Tractate</hi> of his ſhall ſee he layes dovvn both the <hi>agreements</hi> and <hi>differences</hi> it hath from the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> and that of <hi>Nature.</hi> And in regard it may be the thing hath not been <hi>obſerved</hi> by all, and many vvho have not the <hi>Author</hi> by

I will lay down not all, but the <hi>main</hi> heads of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and difference, that this <hi>Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Covenant hath with the Covenant of Nature and Grace. And we will firſt ſhew you its agreements and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the Covenant of Nature. The agreements are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In both theſe Covenants, one <hi>party Covenanting</hi> is God, the other man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That both have a <hi>condition</hi> annexed to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>condition</hi> for the generall is the ſame; <hi>Doe this,</hi> and Live.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the promiſe in the generall is the ſame too; <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the agreements. We will now ſhew you their diſagreements.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Covenant of Nature was made with all men, this ſubſervient Covenant alone with the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Nature doth <hi>bring</hi> us to Chriſt, but not <hi>directly</hi> by it ſelfe, but <hi>obliquely</hi> and <hi>per accidens:</hi> but the <hi>old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> or the ſubſervient Covenant, doth <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>per ſe,</hi> bring unto Chriſt, for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170645:86"/>it was the true and <hi>proper ſcope</hi> which God aymed at in giving of it. <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>God did not make the Convenant of Nature with man, that he being burthened with the weight of it ſhould goe to Chriſt. In gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, God aymed at this, to have that which was his due from man. But in this ſubſervient Covenant, God doth require his right for no other end, then that man being convinced of his weakneſſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency might flie to Chriſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Covenant of nature was made with man, that by it men might be <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> on ſweetly in obedience; for it was <hi>ingraven</hi> in their hearts. But the <hi>ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Covenant was made that men might be <hi>compelled</hi> to obedience; for it did <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beget</hi> to bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Covenant of nature was to be <hi>eternall,</hi> but this ſubſervient Covenant was to be but for a <hi>time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Covenant of nature had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>reſtraint</hi> of outward ſins, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his <hi>principall</hi> uſe nor <hi>leſſe</hi> principal, but the old Covenant in his leſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end had, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Covenant of nature was <hi>ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the heart, but the other <hi>written</hi> in tables of ſtone.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170645:86"/>
            <p n="7">7. The Covenant of <hi>nature</hi> was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; this ſubſervient Covenant in Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The Covenant of <hi>nature</hi> had no <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> but this <hi>ſubſervient</hi> Covenant had a <hi>mediator,</hi> viz. <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The one was made with man <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> the other with a part of mankinde <hi>fallen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are the maine agreements and differences between the Covenant of nature, and this ſubſervient Covenant: We come now to ſhew you the <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>agreements</hi> that it hath with the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They agree that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That both are <hi>contracted</hi> with <hi>fallen</hi> man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That both doe <hi>diſcover</hi> ſinne.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That both doe <hi>bring</hi> to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That both are <hi>contracted</hi> by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That in both is <hi>life</hi> promiſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They differ 1. That in the <hi>ſubſerviint</hi> Covenant God is conſidered as <hi>condemning</hi> ſin, and <hi>approving</hi> alone of righteouſneſſe: But in the Covenant of Grace, as <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi> ſin, and <hi>renuing</hi> holineſſe in us.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170645:87"/>
            <p n="2">2. They differ in the <hi>ſtipulation</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the condition of the old Covenant was this, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> of the new, <hi>Beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They differ in the Antiquitie. The Promiſe was more ancient then the Law. It is ſaid <hi>the Law was added to the Promiſe,</hi> and that 430. yeers after the Promiſe was given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſubſervient Covenant doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,</hi> but with <hi>Coaction</hi> and ſervility; but the Covenant of Grace by a <hi>willing</hi> and Child-like <hi>inclination</hi> of ſpirit, by more freeneſſe and naturalneſſe of ſoule.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the ſubſervient Covenant the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>bondage</hi> is given; but in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The old Covenant did <hi>terrifie</hi> the conſcience; this doth <hi>comfort</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The object of the old was <hi>man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,</hi> or rather <hi>dead</hi> in ſin; of the other is man <hi>awakened,</hi> and <hi>humbled</hi> for ſin.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The one ſhewes the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> but gives no ſtrength to ſervice; this doth both <hi>ſhew</hi> the way, and <hi>give</hi> power.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Both promiſe life, but the one in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the other in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the firſt opinion of the two, which ſeemes a <hi>Rationall</hi> opinion,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170645:87"/>though it want the number of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this opinion ſeemes to be this. The Law is ſaid to be a <hi>Covenant,</hi> as I have ſhewed in divers Scriptures, and if ſo, either a Covenant of <hi>Workes,</hi> or of <hi>Grace,</hi> or ſome <hi>third Covenant;</hi> but not a Covenant of Works, nor a Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſome third Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not a Covenant of <hi>workes,</hi> that I have ſhewed at large; becauſe there was a <hi>former</hi> Covenant, a Covenant of Grace made, and this was but <hi>added</hi> to it, and not in way of <hi>oppoſition,</hi> but ſubſerviency: beſides, this <hi>broken</hi> was capable of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which a Covenant of workes is not capable of: beſides, when they had <hi>broken</hi> this, they were not to be <hi>caſt</hi> by it, but had <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>appeale</hi> from the Law to the Goſpel, from Gods <hi>Iuſtice</hi> offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> pardoning and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you ſee they frequently did, when they implored mercy and pardon, for his names ſake; <hi>For thy name ſake for give, and for thy name ſake cover:</hi> under which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions Chriſt was <hi>darkely</hi> ſhadowed out.</p>
            <p>Againe, if it were a <hi>concluding</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life and death, then could they have had no mercy, no pardon, they muſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170645:88"/>needs have periſhed; but againſt that the apoſtle ſpeaks act. 15.11. <hi>We beleeve through the grace of Chriſt to be ſaved even as they:</hi> Nay, and then it had been utterly <hi>inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent</hi> with the Covenant of Grace. Then were there ſome <hi>ends</hi> and uſes for which the Law was promulged which could not <hi>ſtand with,</hi> but were utterly <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the Promiſe and Covenant of Grace. But I have ſhewed you there were no ſuch ends, — And therefore it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it was ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> under which they <hi>ſtood,</hi> as notwithſtanding that they did <hi>ſtand</hi> under a covenant of Grace, and therfore it could not be a <hi>Covenant</hi> of works. This ſeems to be the reaſon of the opinion againſt the firſt, that though it be called a Covenant, yet it could not be a Covenant of works: And if ſo, then muſt it be either a Covenant of Grace, or ſome <hi>third</hi> Covenant. Now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be ſaid it could not be a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace; Becauſe that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe generally reckon up this as one part of our freedome that wee have by Chriſt, to be freed from the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and if the Law were a Covenant of Grace onely more <hi>Laegally diſpenſed,</hi> and under more <hi>Legall adminiſtrations;</hi> it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170645:88"/>might ſeeme better to ſay, wee are freed from the <hi>Legall</hi> adminiſtrations of it, then to ſay, we are freed from it as a Covenant. And therefore they ſaying we are freed from it as a Covenant, cannot poſſibly hold it to be a Covenant of Grace. I onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound you the reaſon this opinion holds out.</p>
            <p>And if it be neither a Covenant of works, nor a Covenant of Grace, then muſt it of neceſſitie be a third Covenant. And yet this ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> as doth not ſtand in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to Grace, neither is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; for then God ſhould have <hi>contradicted</hi> himſelfe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne his owne purpoſe, repented of his owne promiſe which he had given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore it is called a <hi>ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Covenant, which though it ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>oppoſite tearms,</hi> yet it hath it is <hi>ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient ends</hi> to the Covenant of Grace; and was given by way of <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to the Goſpel, and the more full <hi>revealing</hi> of the covenant of grace, &amp; was <hi>temporary,</hi> &amp; had <hi>reſpect</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi> &amp; Gods bleſſing there, in obedience to it, and not to heaven, for that was <hi>promiſed</hi> by another Covenant which God made with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he entred this. And this is the reaſon that this firſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170645:89"/>holds forth, which I deſire modeſtly to propound, not yet ſeeing wherein it may be <hi>iniurious</hi> to holineſſe, or <hi>diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the minde of God in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond opinion, in which I find the greateſt <hi>Number</hi> of moſt <hi>Holy and learned</hi> Divines to concurre, and that is, that though the Law be called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet was it not a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works for ſalvation; nor was it a third Covenant from Workes and Grace: but it was the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> for nature and kind under which wee ſtand under the Goſpel, even the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, though more <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally diſpenſed</hi> to the Iewes; and it differed not in <hi>ſubſtance</hi> from the Covenant of Grace,

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170645:90"/>grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without feare, in holines and righteouſnes all the dayes of our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will give you for brevity, the full <hi>draught</hi> of their thoughts, who <hi>maintaine</hi> this ſecond opinion in theſe five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was never any more then two <hi>Covenants</hi> made with mankinde, which held out life and ſalvation: The firſt was the <hi>Covenant of Workes,</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; the other is the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> after the fall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was never but one way of ſalvation ſince the fall, and that was by a Covenant of grace: God never ſet up another covenant of workes ſince the fall, hee puts us now to <hi>beleeve</hi> without <hi>working</hi> for life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That yet all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity they lie under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of workes, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> left them after his fall, till they come over to Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the <hi>law</hi> was <hi>never given</hi> as a Covenant of works, but <hi>added</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by way of <hi>ſubſerviencie</hi> to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That though the law was given
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170645:90"/>with <hi>mercifull</hi> purpoſes, and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the covenant of grace; yet it ſeemes to come <hi>handed</hi> to us, as though it were the <hi>repetition</hi> of another covenant of workes under which we ſtand.</p>
            <p>Or rather the <hi>covenant</hi> of grace under the Old Teſtament ſeems to be ſo <hi>legally</hi> repreſented as if it were a covenant of works ſtill to us. And it is worth our obſervation to ſee how the <hi>covenant</hi> of Grace like the <hi>Sun</hi> in the firmament, hath <hi>riſen</hi> up ſtill to further and further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> it was very <hi>darke</hi> and obſcure; from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the time of the Prophets the <hi>light</hi> began to appeare. After the Prophets when <hi>Iohn</hi> began his Miniſtery, then the <hi>light</hi> was more clearely revealed, under the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Chameron.</note> who revealed the <hi>boſome</hi> counſels of his Father, there were more <hi>cleare</hi> and glorious <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of it. After Chriſts <hi>reſurrection</hi> and the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, the <hi>booke</hi> before <hi>claſped,</hi> was now fully <hi>opened, that he that runs might read.</hi> In ſo much that ſome have called the covenant of Grace before Chriſt, <hi>foedus promiſsi,</hi> the covenant of promiſe; and now under the Goſpel the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170645:91"/>covenant of grace, in reſpect of the full, cleare, and ample diſcovery of it: the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi> which before <hi>obſcured</hi> it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; and the whole <hi>platforme of Gods deſigne</hi> of ſaving man by meer grace ſo clearely diſcovered, that he that runnes may read it.</p>
            <p>That which ſtood upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> tearms to the covenant of grace,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>3</label> cannot be ſaid to be a covenant of grace, nor yet <hi>ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> to the covenant of grace; but muſt needs be a covenant of workes.</p>
            <p>But the law ſtood upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> terms to the covenant of grace, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it ſtood upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> termes it is manifeſt,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit juſtitiam et ſalutem cum condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione totius legis implen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae, evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium vero promittit candem fine ulla condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> Chamier.</note> the one commanding <hi>doing,</hi> the other <hi>beleeving:</hi> if you doe conſult with theſe places, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.4, 5. <hi>Ye ſhall keepe my ſtatutes, and my iudgements, which if a man doe he ſhall live in them.</hi> Ezek. 20.11. <hi>I gave them my ſtatutes which if a man doe he ſhall live in them.</hi> Gal. 3.12. <hi>The law is not of faith, but he that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe may be <hi>eluded,</hi> he ſhall live <hi>(in)</hi> them, but he doth not ſay he ſhall live <hi>(by)</hi> them; we live <hi>in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> but we doe not live <hi>by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:170645:91"/>there is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>Therefore leſt this might put it off, ſee more plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the law, but the doers of the law ſhall be iuſtified.</hi> And that the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of the <hi>morall</hi> law he ſhews after, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. where he diſcourſeth of ſome branches of the Morall law: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the law</hi> (yet he doth not ſay which is by the law) <hi>that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them, but the righteouſneſſe which is of faith ſpeakes thus: Whoſoever beleeves on him, ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> verſ. 11. So that the law you ſee by theſe places ſeems to ſtand upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> termes to grace. And this is the Objection which you ſee I have <hi>raiſed</hi> to the height: and if this be cleared, then all is done, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now againſt theſe I might <hi>oppoſe</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Scriptures, which ſeeme to ſpeake againſt it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>But that no man is iuſtified by the law it is evident, for the iuſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Againe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had beene a law given that could have given life, verily righteouſneſſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170645:92"/>had beene by the law:</hi> that is, if the law had beene able to juſtifie or ſave any man, it ſhould have done all men: God would never have ſent Chriſt, but <hi>by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh living be iuſtified,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>Who ever are under the workes of the law, are under the curſe:</hi> and if under the curſe, who ever look for life by obedience to the law, then ſurely God did not ſet up this with this end, that we ſhould have life by obedience to it. <hi>The law entered that ſinne might abound,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and if the Law was given to ſhew the wideneſſe, greatneſſe of ſinne; then ſurely not that we ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by obedience to it, &amp;c. Beſides, <hi>It was given foure hundred and thirty yeares after the promiſe:</hi> God gave the promiſe of life and juſtification before to faith; and had he after given the <hi>law</hi> that we ſhould have <hi>life</hi> by working, then had God beene <hi>contrary</hi> to himſelfe, <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> in his purpoſe, and <hi>repented</hi> of his former mercy; but not this, therefore not the other.</p>
            <p>Beſides, God could not <hi>expect</hi> that we ſhould <hi>doe,</hi> that we might have life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were to have <hi>life</hi> before we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170645:92"/>could doe: Chriſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quod mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veor exili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ad te, non niſi a te Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> Chryſ.</note> 
               <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> We have no <hi>life</hi> but of Chriſt, <hi>he is our life, He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne hath not life:</hi> and dead men cannot work: we could not <hi>doe</hi> that we might <hi>live,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were to be made <hi>alive</hi> that we might <hi>doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, God never <hi>purpoſed</hi> life upon obedience, becauſe he had <hi>decreed</hi> another way to conferre life upon men; this you ſee plaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. where the Apoſtle debates the ſame thing, <hi>But that no man is iuſtified by the law it is evident;</hi> Why, how is that evident? <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the iuſt ſhall live by faith:</hi> as if he had ſaid, God hath decreed another way to life; and therefore ſurely the former is not the way.</p>
            <p>But yet you will ſay, It ſeemes as if the <hi>law</hi> did <hi>require</hi> us to do, and <hi>promiſe</hi> life to doing: and if ſo, certainly the law ſtands upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> tearmes to grace; and therefore can neither be a covenant of grace, nor ſubſervient to it. And if they doe not ſtand upon oppoſite tearms, how ſhall we underſtand this, <hi>Doe this and live?</hi> For the <hi>reconciling</hi> of this oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170645:93"/>and <hi>unfolding</hi> the meaning of <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> I will lay downe ſixe or ſeven particulars to be conſidered of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> hath not refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>morall law</hi> onely, but to the <hi>ceremoniall</hi> alſo (as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.4, 5.) which was their Goſpel; eſpecially if you looke upon the <hi>ceremony,</hi> not as it is an <hi>appendix</hi> to the Morall law, but as it carries a <hi>typicall</hi> relation to Chriſt, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>lamb</hi> ſlaine did point out to Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> The Goſpel was darkely adminiſtred and ſhadowed out by the Ceremonie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This was not ſpoken of the law <hi>abſtractly,</hi> and ſeparately conſidered; but of the Law and Promiſe <hi>ioyntly;</hi> not of the Law <hi>excluſively,</hi> but of the Law <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively,</hi> as including the Promiſe; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Promiſe involved with it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He doth not bid them <hi>Doe and live by doing;</hi> but <hi>doe and live in doing;</hi> we may live [in] obedience, though we doe not, nor cannot live [by] obedience. We could not <hi>live</hi> by them, till we had <hi>life;</hi> but that is not by <hi>doing,</hi> but by <hi>beleeving,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>You would not come to me
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170645:93"/>that you might have life;</hi> that was not by <hi>works,</hi> but by <hi>grace. If there had beene a law given that could have given life,</hi> either <hi>life</hi> that we might obey, or <hi>life</hi> upon our obedience; <hi>verily righteouſneſſe ſhould have beene by the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Some thinke that God after he had given the <hi>promiſe</hi> of life, and <hi>tendered</hi> life upon beleeving, he <hi>repeated</hi> the covenant of works in the law, to put man to his choice, whether he would now be <hi>ſaved</hi> by working or beleeving. And this the rather to <hi>empty</hi> them of themſelves, and anſwer them in theſe thoughts, which perhaps they might think that they were able to come to life by obedience, and therefore God puts them to the <hi>triall:</hi> and leſt they ſhould thinke that any <hi>wrong</hi> was done to them, he gives them a <hi>repetitition</hi> of the former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and as it were, puts them to their <hi>choice</hi> whether they would be ſaved by working or beleeving; that when they were <hi>convinced</hi> of their owne impotencie, they might better ſee, <hi>admire,</hi> adore, advance the <hi>mercy</hi> of God who hath <hi>given</hi> a Promiſe, ſent a Chriſt, to <hi>ſave</hi> thoſe that were not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170645:94"/>
               <hi>able</hi> to doe any thing towards their own ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others think that <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> hath reference onely to a <hi>temporall</hi> and proſperous life in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> if they would be <hi>conformable</hi> to that law which God had given them, and <hi>obey him</hi> in his commands, then ſhould they <hi>live,</hi> and live <hi>proſperouſly</hi> in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> which he had given them: he would bleſſe their basket and ſtore,
<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is another interpretation, and that is, that <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> though it was ſpoken to them <hi>immediately,</hi> yet not <hi>terminatively,</hi> but through them to Chriſt, who <hi>hath fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for us,</hi> and purchaſed <hi>life</hi> by his own obedience.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe I reject, and I can cloſe with none of theſe, only I propound this tariety. I will give you my own thoughts of it in briefe.</p>
            <p>I grant that in the <hi>externall view</hi> of them (what ever it is in truth) the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpell</hi> doe ſeeme to ſtand upon <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> tearms, but yet theſe oppoſite tearms on which the Law ſeemes to ſtand, had its <hi>ſubſervient</hi> ends to Chriſt and Grace. For all this was but to <hi>awaken</hi> them, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170645:94"/>
               <hi>convince</hi> them of their own <hi>impotency,</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> them for it, and to <hi>drive</hi> them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. If indeed we looke upon the Law <hi>ſeparately,</hi> ſo it ſeemes to ſtand upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> termes, and we may anſwer the queſtion, which yet the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Is the Law againſt the Promiſes? God forbid,</hi> and ſay, yea it is againſt the Promiſes, as it ſaith, <hi>Doe this and live; for if of works, then not of grace.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſo <hi>interpret</hi> this; <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> that we may not make it <hi>againſt</hi> the Promiſes. Now I ſay,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex &amp; Evangelium mutuo ſibi dant manus.</hi> Pet. Mart. <hi>Lex &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium ſunt ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita.</hi> Alſt.</note> if you looke upon the Law <hi>ſeparately,</hi> ſo it ſtands upon oppoſite termes and is againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But if you looke upon it <hi>relatively,</hi> as it hath reſpect to the Promiſe, ſo theſe <hi>oppoſite</hi> termes have their <hi>ſubſervient</hi> ends to the Promiſe and Grace. And that by <hi>convincing</hi> us of our own <hi>impotencie</hi> and weakneſſe, that we might <hi>goe</hi> over to Chriſt and the Promiſe for life. I ſhewed you this was the difference between the Covenant made with man in Innocency, and between Gods <hi>requires</hi> in the Law: In the former, God did not <hi>require</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that man being <hi>burthened</hi> with the <hi>weight</hi> of his worke ſhould goe to Chriſt, but this was it God <hi>aymed</hi> at there to have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170645:95"/>that which was his <hi>due</hi> from man. But now in the Law God doth <hi>require</hi> his <hi>right</hi> for no other end, then that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>convinced</hi> of his weakneſſe, and <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> might <hi>flie</hi> to Chriſt. And therefore though <hi>doe this and live</hi> be againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet if you look upon the <hi>end</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſaid ſo, to <hi>diſcover</hi> our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to <hi>humble</hi> us for it, to <hi>drive</hi> us out of our ſelves; ſo you will ſee ſweet <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> and <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to the Promiſe.

            <p>The courſe that Chriſt takes with the <hi>young man</hi> is very obſervable, and fully proves that which I have ſaid to you, you ſhall read it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.16. and ſo on. <hi>Good Maſter, ſaith he, what ſhall I doe that I may inherit eternall life?</hi> Here was his queſtion, &amp;c. You ſhall ſee Chriſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the latter end of the 17. verſe. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> This was a ſtrange <hi>Anſwer,</hi> was the Law a <hi>way?</hi> wherefore did he then come into the world? or was the young man able to keepe it? that is impoſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Who ever are under the works of the Law, they are under the curſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>curſed is he that obeyeth not in all things in the booke of the Law,</hi> and that is impoſſible. This was therefore a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Anſwer that Chriſt made to his Queſtion, he doth not ſay, as in other places, If thou wilt enter into life <hi>beleeve,</hi> but here, <hi>keep</hi> the commandments, yet if you looke now upon the <hi>perſon</hi> to whom Chriſt ſpake, and the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you will ſee the meaning.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170645:96"/>
               <hi>All this I have kept from my youth,</hi> and therefore Chriſt ſets him to the Law, not for an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of juſtification, for he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſame Queſtion otherwiſe, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.28, 29. but he ſets him to the Law as a <hi>glaſſe</hi> to diſcover his imperfections, that being <hi>convinced</hi> of his impotency, and being <hi>humbled</hi> for it, he might come over to Chriſt for life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>When men will be <hi>Saviours</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they looke for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> by the Law; Chriſt bids them go and <hi>keepe</hi> the commandements, <hi>ſervanda mandata,</hi> and this to <hi>humble</hi> them, and to <hi>bring</hi> them to him.

Not that I thinke they did <hi>imagine</hi> righteouſneſſe by the <hi>Morall</hi> Law alone, for there they could not but ſee they were <hi>caſt</hi> and gone, but by the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall</hi> Law <hi>with</hi> the <hi>Morall,</hi> God had <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> them theſe Laws, and often ſaid, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> Therefore they thought by <hi>ſubiection</hi> to them to have life. And what they <hi>wanted</hi> in the <hi>Morall,</hi> they went to <hi>make up</hi> in the <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> they would <hi>do</hi> ſomething the <hi>Morall</hi> Law commanded, and goe to the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> for what they could not doe, not that <hi>all</hi> did ſo, yet <hi>many</hi> of them. But this was farre from Gods end, It was their own <hi>errour,</hi> and miſtake, as the Apoſtle ſeemes to imply, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>They have a zeale to God, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge: for they being ignorant, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, but went about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a righteouſneſſe of their own;</hi> they went about it, but could not attaine it, all this was but ſetting a <hi>dead</hi> man on his feet, and this aroſe from their <hi>ignorance,</hi> their errour and miſtake. They did as poore <hi>ignorant</hi> ſouls doe with us, we bid them <hi>pray,</hi> we bid them <hi>obey,</hi> doe duties,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170645:97"/>and poore ſoules <hi>all</hi> they doe they doe in <hi>reference</hi> to juſtification by them, they <hi>ſpin</hi> a thred of their own righteouſneſſe to <hi>apparell</hi> themſelves with all.

So hard it is to be <hi>in</hi> dutie in reſpect of <hi>performance,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of dutie in reſpect of <hi>dependance;</hi> this is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their reach, to <hi>doe all</hi> righteouſneſſe, and yet to <hi>reſt</hi> in none but Chriſts. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine memorabor iuſtitiae tuae ſolius, Lord I will make mention of thy righteouſneſſe only,</hi> and that is mine too, for <hi>Chriſt is made to me, wiſdome, righteouſneſſe</hi> — 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29.</p>
            <p>And thus I have <hi>Anſwered</hi> the firſt great <hi>Query,</hi> and thoſe <hi>obiections</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on it. And may lay down theſe two Poſitions as firme Concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Law for ſubſtance of it, doth remaine as a Rule of obedience to the people of God, and that to which they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their walking under the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there was no end or uſe for which the Law was given, but might conſiſt with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170645:97"/>Grace, and be ſerviceable to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond Query.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether this be any part of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Chriſt,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Query. </seg>2</label> to be free from all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and chaſtiſements for ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we do <hi>conſult</hi> with the Scriptures,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> they ſeeme to hold out this to us; That Gods <hi>people,</hi> ſuch whoſe ſinnes are yet <hi>pardoned,</hi> may yet beare chaſtiſements for ſinne. That they have been <hi>under</hi> the <hi>rod,</hi> under the corrections, and chaſtiſements of God, that is plaine; <hi>Abraham, David, Moſes,</hi> and all were, and the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>If we be not chaſtiſed, we are baſtards and not ſonnes, for he ſcourgeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſonne he receiveth.</hi> And that theſe <hi>corrections</hi> have been <hi>inflicted</hi> on them <hi>for</hi> ſin, the Scripture ſeems to hold forth <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complaine, a man for the puniſhment of his ſinne? Let us ſearch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Micah</hi> 1.5. <hi>For the wickedneſſe of Iacob, and for the ſinne of Iſrael is all this — Micah</hi> 7.9. The Church ſaith, <hi>She will beare the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, becauſe ſhe had ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi> Nay, it is laid down as <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> condition, to goe before Gods <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall</hi> of calamities from them, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170645:98"/>they were to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves for ſin, and <hi>turne</hi> from ſinne before God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. <hi>If their uncircumciſed hearts ſhall be humbled, and if they ſhall accept of the puniſhment of their iniquitie,</hi> what is that? that is, if they would <hi>iuſtifie</hi> God in his proceeding againſt them, if they would <hi>lye downe</hi> in the duſt and <hi>owne</hi> their puniſhment, and ſay, that their <hi>ſinnes</hi> have <hi>deſerved</hi> it, and acknowledge Gods <hi>Iuſtice</hi> in afflicting them, <hi>then would he remember his Covenant and help them.</hi> And all this you ſee was done by the <hi>Princes</hi> of Iſrael, when they were puniſhed by the hand of <hi>Shiſhak,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6. It is ſaid, <hi>They hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves under the mightie hand of God, and ſaid, the Lord is righteous,</hi> that is, he doth <hi>iuſtly</hi> afflict us for our ſin we have committed. So that this proves that they were puniſhed for their ſins. For if they were to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves <hi>for ſinne</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, if they were to <hi>iuſtifie</hi> God in his dealing, then ſure God did <hi>afflict</hi> them for ſinne.</p>
            <p>But now againſt this it may be it will be ſaid,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> that this was ſpoken of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and not of them alone who were godly.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170645:98"/>
            <p>I grant it was ſpoken to the <hi>whole</hi> Church,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> yet the <hi>godly</hi> themſelves were to doe the <hi>ſame duties</hi> with them, they were not to be <hi>exempted,</hi> they were to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves for ſinne, as you ſee <hi>Daniel, Ezra</hi> did: and if that <hi>ſin</hi> was not the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and thoſe calamities <hi>inflicted</hi> on them for ſinne, then were they to <hi>hold forth</hi> an untruth, for to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves <hi>for ſinne</hi> as the <hi>cauſe</hi> why Gods <hi>hand</hi> was gone out againſt them, and to accept of the puniſhment of their iniquitie, and to <hi>declare</hi> God is righteous in it; if God did not <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> them for ſinne, was certainly to hold out an <hi>untruth,</hi> which cannot be allowed of.</p>
            <p>But admit this, that this was ſpoken of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> yet we have places to <hi>evidence,</hi> that God hath <hi>puniſhed</hi> his owne people for ſinne, ſuch as was his deare ones. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> they were <hi>ſhut</hi> out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God would not <hi>ſuffer</hi> them to <hi>enter</hi> into the Land of Promiſe. And this was a great <hi>affliction:</hi> and if you looke into <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12. you ſhall ſee that this was for ſinne, <hi>becauſe they ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified not God at the waters of Meribah.</hi> As he tels them; <hi>Becauſe you beleeved not to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170645:99"/>of Iſrael: Therefore you ſhall not bring the Congregation into the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>David,</hi> of whom God <hi>profeſſeth,</hi> that he was a man after his owne <hi>heart,</hi> yet you ſee how God did <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> him, his <hi>child</hi> dies, the Sword ſhould not <hi>depart</hi> from his houſe, his owne <hi>ſonne</hi> roſe up in <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt him: theſe were great <hi>calamities;</hi> and if you look into the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10. you ſhall ſee the cauſe of this to be his ſinne, his murder and adultery. <hi>Now therefore the Sword ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thy houſe becauſe thou haſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me, and haſt taken the wife of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah to be thy wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now againſt this it may be it will be ſaid,

            <p>I told you in the anſwer to the former queſtion that ſome <hi>Divines</hi> did <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> of a threefold covenant:
<label type="milestone">

               </label> a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature, a covenant of Grace, and a ſubſervient covenant; which laſt was that which was made with the Iewes in <hi>Sinai, contained</hi> in the Morall, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, Iudiciall laws: a <hi>covenant</hi> which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170645:99"/>though it ſtood upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> tearmes, yet had it's <hi>ſubſervient</hi> ends to the covenant of grace. A <hi>covenant</hi> which God made with <hi>iſrael</hi> when they were to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had <hi>chiefly</hi> reſpect unto their good or evill in it. Wherein God <hi>promiſed bleſſings</hi> upon obedience, and <hi>threatened calamities</hi> and judgements on them if they diſobeyed. As you ſee them at large annexed to it, in the 28. and the 29. Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi> And all this by way of <hi>ſubſerviencie</hi> unto the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that when they <hi>ſaw</hi> they were neither <hi>able</hi> to <hi>obtaine</hi> life, nor outward mercies; nor <hi>keepe off</hi> death, and temporall evils, by their <hi>obedience</hi> to it, they might <hi>look out</hi> for the <hi>promiſe</hi> of grace, and <hi>long</hi> for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> all theſe upon <hi>better</hi> grounds: And into this <hi>covenant</hi> they did all <hi>enter</hi> with God, and <hi>bound</hi> it with an <hi>oath,</hi> and a <hi>curſe,</hi> as you ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12.19.

            <p>It is true, the things that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and forbidden, were <hi>morally</hi> good and evill, and ſo of <hi>perpetuall</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; yet the <hi>tearmes</hi> on which they ſeeme to be commanded and forbidden, and they obeyed, are gone, which were proſperitie or calamities, good or evill, in the Land which God gave them.

            <p n="1">1. By way of Grant, that <hi>this</hi> or that <hi>particular</hi> ſinne, may ſometimes be ſaid rather to be the <hi>occaſion,</hi> then the <hi>cauſe</hi> of an affliction.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. And for thoſe <hi>Allegations,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170645:106"/>they will but <hi>afford</hi> them little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.

            <p>This is all I ſhall ſay for Anſwer to

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> whereby they would prove <hi>that God doth not puniſh for ſinne,</hi> is this, If God doe <hi>take</hi> away the <hi>cauſe,</hi> then he takes away the <hi>effect</hi> alſo. <hi>Sinne</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all puniſhment, <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> is the <hi>effect</hi> of ſinne; now if God doe take away the <hi>cauſe</hi> which is ſinne, then the <hi>effect</hi> which is the <hi>puniſhment of ſinne:</hi> if the body be removed, the ſhadow muſt be gone too: ſinne is the body, and puniſhment the ſhadow, take away ſin, and the puniſhment muſt needs be taken away.

            <p>And this ſeemes to be <hi>granted</hi> in the thing it ſelfe, <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne: what is <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of ſinne, but a <hi>removing</hi> of guilt? what is <hi>guilt,</hi> but an <hi>obligation</hi> and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us over to <hi>puniſhment:</hi> Spirituall, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, eternall?

            <p>I will proceed no further.</p>
            <p>Vnto all this give me leave to add thus much in this <hi>unhappy</hi> difference, and we will <hi>conclude</hi> this Anſwer. I will but give you a few thoughts to conſider of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinne doth <hi>naturally</hi> bring <hi>evill</hi> on us: as there is <hi>peace</hi> and good in the <hi>waies</hi> of holineſſe, ſo there is <hi>evil</hi> and trouble in the <hi>waies</hi> of ſinne; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>ſeparated:</hi> trouble is the <hi>naturall</hi> and proper <hi>fruit</hi> of ſinne, that which it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beares. Nay it is in the very bowels of it: Sinne is <hi>malum Catholicum:</hi> It is a <hi>bigge bellied</hi> evill; all evils are the <hi>births</hi> of ſinne: if you could <hi>rippe</hi> up ſinne, you ſhould find all evil in the <hi>bowels</hi> of it: there may be evil of <hi>puniſhment</hi> where there is no evill of ſinne in it; but all evil of <hi>puniſhment</hi> lies in the <hi>evil</hi> of ſinne: all the Commandements were given for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170645:110"/>good, and your good lies in obedience to them. And he that <hi>breakes</hi> Gods bounds, doth neceſſarily runne upon evill and trouble: Sinne is the <hi>birth</hi> of our hearts, and trouble is the <hi>birth</hi> of ſinne; and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is as true a <hi>child</hi> of ſinne, as ſinne is the naturall <hi>iſſue</hi> of our ſouls. This is the firſt: ſinne doth not only by conſequence and Gods ordination, but naturally, bring evil and trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the evil that ſin brings, or the trouble that comes by ſin; either it is by <hi>chance,</hi> or by <hi>providence,</hi> and by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpenſation: But not by <hi>chance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> tels us ſo; and ſure he tels us truth; <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they doe not ariſe out of the duſt:</hi> And Chriſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diſpouit membra pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis et cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis.</hi> Aug.</note> 
               <hi>There cannot a haire fall from our head, without a providence:</hi> And if not a haire, if not the ſmalleſt thing without a providence, then much <hi>leſſe</hi> the greater. So then the evil that comes by ſinne, is not by chance, but by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Divine diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If from <hi>providence,</hi> then either from Gods <hi>active,</hi> or from his <hi>paſſive</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: or if you will, take it thus; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his <hi>permiſſive</hi> providence, or by his <hi>active</hi> ordaining <hi>providence.</hi> To ſay by his <hi>permiſsive</hi> providence onely, this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170645:111"/>cannot ſo well ſuit with God who is all <hi>act,</hi> nor with the words of the Prophet, <hi>Is there any evill in the Citie which I have not done?</hi> You know it is meant onely of the <hi>evils</hi> of puniſhment; not of the <hi>evill</hi> of ſinne, there God hath no hand.</p>
            <p>There are many things which God <hi>permits</hi> in the world, which he doth not doe; thoſe are the evils of ſinne. But the evils of puniſhment theſe he permits and doth too. <hi>Is there any evill in the Citie which I have not done?</hi> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.24, 25. where the Prophet makes the ſame queſtion; and gives the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>Who gave Iacob for a ſpoyle, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to the robbers? Did not the Lord, He againſt whom we have ſinned?</hi>—So that you ſee all theſe come from divine diſpenſation. God brings this evill, and he tels us for ſinne too.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If God doe in <hi>providence</hi> bring any evill upon his people, then either out of <hi>love,</hi> or out of <hi>anger,</hi> or out of <hi>hatred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Not out of <hi>batred;</hi> ſo we grant that cannot be: there is <hi>nothing</hi> that God doth to his people, that is any <hi>fruit</hi> or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of hatred. Indeed <hi>afflictions</hi> on the wicked are fruits of hatred; ſome <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings</hi> before the great ſhowre of <hi>wrath</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170645:111"/>fall upon them; but it is not ſo with his owne people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then ſecondly, either out of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>anger.</hi> Certainly not out of anger meerly without love; for the <hi>principle,</hi> the <hi>ground,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of all his dealings with his people is <hi>love;</hi> there is nothing he doth to them <hi>ſeparated</hi> from love, there is love in all; Nay, and I ſay, from love they proceed: for <hi>all his waies are waies of mercy to them that feare him,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. But becauſe <hi>afflictions,</hi> and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>evils,</hi> and doe ſeeme to be the <hi>effects</hi> of one angrie and diſpleaſed; therefore I ſay, though they come from love, yet from <hi>love diſpleaſed,</hi> from love offended. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27.
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.27.</note> 
               <hi>God had mercy on him in reſtoring Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to health.</hi> Why? had it not beene a mercy to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died too? Are not all his wayes, wayes of mercy? and therefore though he had died, had it not beene a mercy too? What ſhall we ſay to this? ſhall we ſay it had been a <hi>mercy</hi> in the iſſue, and event, as God would <hi>ſanctifie</hi> it to him, and doe him good by it, as he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>All things ſhall worke together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. Indeed this is good,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170645:112"/>but this is not all; ſinne it ſelfe may be a <hi>mercy</hi> in the iſſue. But the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>all his wayes, are wayes of mercy,</hi> not a <hi>ſtep</hi> God takes towards his people, not an <hi>action</hi> that God doth, not one <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of providence, but it is out of mercy. And therefore what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God had mercy on me in reſtoring of him? what needs he to ſay ſo? ſeeing it had beene a mercy if he had beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away? and God had ſhewed mercy to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died? why then doth he ſay, God had mercy upon me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of him? Indeed it had been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died, but a <hi>correcting</hi> mercy, mercy in chaſtiſement; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeemes by this phraſe to imply a <hi>medium,</hi> or at leaſt a difference between <hi>mercy reſtoring,</hi> and <hi>mercy depriving</hi> of him. It had beene mercy, but a <hi>correcting</hi> mercy, had God taken him away. — So I ſay here, though afflictions and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are out of love; yet becauſe they are in themſelves evill, therefore I ſay, they proceed often (not alwaies) from <hi>love diſpleaſed,</hi> from love offended.</p>
            <p>We ſay indeed, that God is angry, not that we are to conceive there is <hi>anger</hi> in God, he hath no <hi>paſsions</hi> or affections in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170645:112"/>him; but we ſay he is angry,
<note place="margin">Ira non eſt affectus, ſed effectus in Deo.</note> becauſe he <hi>deales</hi> with us, as men uſe to deale with ſuch with whom they are angry; they <hi>withdraw</hi> from them, they <hi>chide</hi> them, they <hi>rebuke</hi> them, <hi>correct</hi> them; and ſo doth God, in a paternall diſpleaſure, with them he dearely loves.</p>
            <p>But we will come to ſhut up this Query in a few particulars which we will lay downe for your full ſatisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>God doth not <hi>ever chaſtiſe</hi> his people for ſinne. I ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſi. </seg>1</label> all the chaſtiſements which God inflicts upon his people they are not for ſinne: there are ſome which he inflicteth for the <hi>prevention</hi> of ſinne; as <hi>Pauls</hi> temptation was.

So that though it be granted God doth chaſtiſe for ſinne, yet all the <hi>afflictions</hi> with which God doth <hi>exerciſe</hi> us, they are not for ſin: though it might be ſaid, that ſinne is the generall ground of all calamities; yet it may be ſaid, that this or that affliction,

<note place="margin">Eo quod ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum grave, quod tuum leve.</note> to a <hi>ſon-like;</hi> from a ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> to a ſpirit of <hi>libertie;</hi> hee hath broken the <hi>bonds</hi> of ſubiection to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords, that wee might take on us the <hi>yoke</hi> of ſervice to him, <hi>whoſe * yoke is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, whoſe burden is light,</hi> Mat. 11.30. And therefore the Apoſtle inferres, after hee
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170645:114"/>had ſet down the main <hi>priviledges</hi> which we enjoy by the <hi>redemption</hi> of Chriſt, as Iuſtification, freedome from the guilt and power of ſinne, hee ſaith, <hi>therefore we are debtors not to the fleſh, to live after the fleſh, but to the ſpirit, to live after the ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.12. A trueth ſo plaine,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.12.</note> as if it it were written with a <hi>Sunbeame.</hi> It is as eaſie to ſeparate the <hi>light</hi> from the Sunne, as holines and obedience from the perſon iuſtified, &amp;c. <hi>The grace of God which hath appeared to us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live piouſly godlily, &amp; ſoberly in this preſent world,</hi> 2 Titus 11.12.
<note place="margin">2 Tit. 11.12</note> So that of the firſt part there is no controverſie, it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with our freedome to be tyed to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or performance of dutie, nay, it is part of our <hi>redemption,</hi> and part of our <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> And indeed that is true and <hi>reall bondage,</hi> which is not ioyned with <hi>ſincere</hi> and true obedience.</p>
            <p>But now there is ſome controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſecond part of it; <hi>Whether this be any infringeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our Chriſtian liberty to be tyed to duty, becauſe God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Many (though they would do dutie, yet they would not be tyed to it, they would rather doe it upon the <hi>inclinations</hi> of their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170645:115"/>owne ſpirits, then upon the <hi>impoſitions</hi> of God. There are three miſtakes about this.</p>
            <p>Some thinke they <hi>ought</hi> not to do <hi>duty,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Miſtake </seg>1</label> but when the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God doth move them to it.</p>
            <p>Indeed when the Spirit <hi>moves,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> it is good to goe, <hi>ſpread</hi> your <hi>ſailes</hi> when the <hi>winde</hi> blowes, <hi>open</hi> when he <hi>knocketh.</hi> As it was ſaid to <hi>David</hi> when he heard the noiſe in the Mulberie trees then he ſhould <hi>go out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 5.24</note> 
               <hi>for God was gone out before him:</hi> So when you finde ſuch <hi>ſtrong movings</hi> upon your ſpirits, it is good to take thoſe <hi>hints</hi> of the Spirit, it is good to cloſe with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Many are like <hi>harlots</hi> that will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the child in the womb, to avoid the trouble of child-birth: So they will <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the <hi>births</hi> of the Spirit, becauſe they would not be at the <hi>trouble</hi> of the worke. That is a fearfull ſinne, to caſt <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> and coole any <hi>motions</hi> of the Spirit of God. When God moves, hee comes with power too, for the performance of the dutie, then we goe full ſaile, and it is good to take thoſe hints. But good hearts do often here miſtake to their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing, and think if they do not goe with every motion how unſeaſonable ſoever
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170645:115"/>they have quenched, and rejected a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit. I conceive it therefore not amiſſe to tell you that ſomtimes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> may put us upon dutie, when wee think the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God doth it, and that you will thinke is ſtrange, but yet it is a trueth. And there are foure times when Satan doth uſually put men on duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When our <hi>ſpirits</hi> are much <hi>ſunk</hi> and downe, either <hi>oppreſſed</hi> with temptations or troubles, then he may put you on to doe dutie: not but that I ſay God doth at theſe times put us upon dutie; but yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Satan too. He deales with us, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> with the Iſraelites, when they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> oppreſſed with their captivitie, then they ſay, <hi>Come now ſing us one of the ſongs of Sion;</hi> ſo when the ſpirit is <hi>oppreſſed</hi> and overwhelmed, when he thinkes we are upon ſome great <hi>diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> and wee ſhall but <hi>torture</hi> our ſelves, and <hi>diſcourage</hi> our ſelves more, then it may be hee puts us to pray, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, like them who dealt with Chriſt, blinded his eyes,
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.65.</note> and then <hi>bid him prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie who ſtrikes him;</hi> ſo when he hath <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> our eyes, he bids us now ſee, now <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,</hi> now pray, when he hath <hi>diſturbed</hi> our ſpirits, when he hath <hi>troubled</hi> the ſea,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170645:116"/>that it caſts up nothing but <hi>mire</hi> and dirt, diſtruſtfull and unbeleeving thoughts, then he bids us goe and pray: which yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times helps to <hi>lay</hi> the ſtorm, and quiet the <hi>ſpirit</hi> too, and Satan loſeth by it; it proves his owne diſadvanage, <hi>unexpected</hi> Grace comes in which he was not aware of, nor could foreſee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond time when Satan may put us on duty is, When wee are called by God upon <hi>other imployments,</hi> either <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> 1. <hi>Spirituall,</hi> either to heare, to confer, or to do other duties, then he bids thee go pray, he loves to make du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>interfere,</hi> 2. or when we are called upon <hi>naturall</hi> imployments, it may be to eat, drink, to ſleep, and ſomtimes he hath carried a poor ſoule out of his bed, or from his meat, and he muſt now go pray, which perhaps hath not beene for Satans advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage neither. Thus he ſometimes deales with <hi>poore</hi> ſoules in temptation, and if they do not do it upon his <hi>inſtigation,</hi> then he tells them they have <hi>reſiſted</hi> a motion of the Spirit. If they do, why it is for their <hi>trouble</hi> too; perhaps he will charge them after all with Popery and ſuperſtition, and voluntary penance, that they muſt riſe in the night to go to prayer, &amp;c. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170645:116"/>this at your hand? It were good in ſuch caſes to ſay with a Godly man, who was thus <hi>moved</hi> to prayer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to go to ſleep, <q rend="inline">Get thee hence Satan, I will goe to dutie when God calls, not when thou ſuggeſts, I have <hi>committed</hi> my ſoul into the arms of Chriſt, and in his arms I reſt and ſleep. —</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third time when Satan may put us on duty. When we are <hi>weake</hi> in body, and not able to perform it, when we want <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> ſpirits to doe the work, then will he put on to it, he knows that if we do it, then he ſhall by reaſon of our <hi>naturall</hi> weaknes get advantage of us. When he puts us to lift <hi>loggs,</hi> he knows we are weak. When he <hi>moves</hi> to dutie, he <hi>knowes</hi> we have no ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth time when hee puts us upon duty is, When he <hi>thinks</hi> he puts us upon a <hi>ſnare,</hi> when he thinkes dutie will be a ſnare to us, hee puts us on it not as Gods worke, but as <hi>our ſnare,</hi> hee moves us to it meerly as a <hi>ſcruple,</hi> and to ſcruple us further, whether we do it, or do not doe it; he puts us on <hi>duty,</hi> not to <hi>comfort</hi> us, but to <hi>torment</hi> us and vex us, not to <hi>raiſe</hi> us when we are <hi>deiected,</hi> but to <hi>caſt</hi> us lower, though he be often miſtaken.</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170645:117"/>
            <p>But yet though Satan doth ſometime as you ſee, yet Gods Spirit doth often move and ſtirre up the heart to dutie, and when he <hi>moves</hi> indeed, he <hi>moves effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> he puts you on the <hi>dutie,</hi> and gives you <hi>ſtrength</hi> to doe it, he carryes you through it, &amp;c. And it is good to obſerve Gods times, the hints of the Spirit, and goe with them, which is the firſt Anſwer to that miſtake.</p>
            <p>But though we are to <hi>goe</hi> when Gods Spirit <hi>moves,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> yet are we not to <hi>neglect</hi> when we doe not <hi>perceive</hi> ſuch <hi>ſenſible</hi> motions of the Spirit. Grace <hi>moves</hi> us, or ſhould move us to <hi>converſe</hi> with God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and if ſo, the <hi>Spirit</hi> moves, the Spirit <hi>regenerated,</hi> though the Spirit <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating</hi> doth not appeare, and Gods Spirit may move <hi>ſecretly,</hi> though not <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently,</hi> and ſenſibly to thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if you looke for an <hi>immediate</hi> call upon the dutie, then you will not do dutie out of <hi>obedience</hi> to the command. We muſt doe dutie ſometime out of obedience, although we want both a heart <hi>to it,</hi> and a heart <hi>in it.</hi> That <hi>dutie</hi> is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of God which is gotten and <hi>wreſted</hi> out of the hands of the fleſh, which is done againſt temptations and gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170645:117"/>Beſides, if you will never goe to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie but when the Spirit ſenſibly moves, you would often want that communion with God which you doe enjoy; How often have you gone to prayer with a <hi>dead</hi> heart, and roſe with a <hi>quicke</hi> heart, with a <hi>ſtrait,</hi> and roſe againe with an <hi>inlarged</hi> heart, with a <hi>deiected,</hi> and roſe <hi>comforted?</hi> How often when you could finde no ſuch motion of God before to it, have you yet met with God in the dutie, and injoyed God, in a prayer, in a glorious ſweet way? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that reioyceth, and worketh righteouſneſſe, them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee in thy wayes:</hi> God loves to meet thoſe that are in his way. Though the <hi>Millar</hi> be not able to command a wind, yet he will <hi>ſpread</hi> his ſayls, be in the way to have it, if it come. Though the <hi>lame</hi> man could not get into the <hi>waters,</hi> nor command the movings of them: yet he would lye 38. yeares by the waters ſide, and no queſtion with a deale of <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> every time the <hi>waters</hi> moved; <hi>Oh that ſome would throw me in!</hi> So though we cannot bring the Spirit to us, yet let us ſet our ſelves <hi>in</hi> the way for him to meet with us. Hold up the <hi>performance</hi> of dutie: by them you come to ſee the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170645:118"/>
               <hi>face</hi> of God, to have <hi>converſes</hi> with him, you keepe <hi>head</hi> againſt ſinne, you get <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes</hi> of ſtrength from Chriſt, you get <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> the world, they that ſpeake againſt performance of dutie, might as well ſpeake againſt the <hi>actings</hi> of faith,

But we will ſhut up this. So much for the firſt miſtake, which was that ſome thinke, they are not to doe dutie, but when the Spirit of God moves them to it.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond miſtake.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Miſtake. </seg>2</label> Some think they are to doe nothing elſe but to pray, God hath <hi>commanded</hi> us to pray, and they thinke they are to doe nothing elſe, and therefore ever and anon they run to their knees, <hi>drop</hi> as it were a <hi>bead,</hi> ſay over a <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and too much with a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> ſpirit too, even as ſo much done to compaſſe life; ſo much laid out for the purchaſe of a pardon, and heaven. There are too many ſuch.</p>
            <p>They are eſpecially two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such who are <hi>blind</hi> and ignorant, they would faine go to heaven, and they heare

            <p n="2">2. Such who are in <hi>humiliation,</hi> and wounds of ſpirit: poore ſouls! they goe ever and anon to their knees, which yet in ſome is the <hi>dawning</hi> of faith,

            <p>
               <hi>Naturally,</hi> men run to a <hi>Covenant</hi> of works, but it muſt be another <hi>worke</hi> to bring us to Chriſt: A <hi>convinced</hi> man runs to a Covenant of works. But he muſt be a <hi>converted</hi> man, that comes over to the Covenant of Grace. So much for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond miſtake.</p>
            <p>A third miſtake.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Miſtake. </seg>3</label> Some there are that thinke they are not to doe dutie, becauſe God commands, but becauſe their own <hi>hearts incline</hi> them to it.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, and ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> That though we muſt doe duties, <hi>becauſe</hi> God hath <hi>commanded</hi> us, yet it is not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to doe them <hi>meerely,</hi> becauſe God hath commanded them. You muſt pray, you muſt heare, and doe other
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170645:119"/>duties; <hi>becauſe</hi> God hath commanded, but it is not ſufficient you do them <hi>meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe God hath commanded them.</p>
            <p>For the explication of this, you muſt know there are two-fold lawes. Poſitive, and Naturall.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lege Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium in</hi> 5. Matth 17. verſ. 63. p.</note> Some that are <hi>poſitive.</hi> 2. Some that are <hi>naturall</hi> Or there are ſome <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> which are <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>Gods will;</hi> and ſome that are <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thoſe that are founded upon Gods <hi>will,</hi> are ſuch as are <hi>good,</hi> becauſe God <hi>commands</hi> them; and ſuch were many under the Old Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> and their <hi>meats</hi> forbidden, which were things neither good nor evill in <hi>themſelves,</hi> but as God had commanded, or forbad them.</p>
            <p>Some againe which were <hi>founded</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods <hi>nature,</hi> and were <hi>intrinſecally</hi> and inherently good in themſelves; and not onely good becauſe God commanded them, but in themſelves good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now for the firſt of theſe, thoſe which were <hi>founded</hi> upon Gods <hi>meere will,</hi> as thoſe lawes before mentioned; it was <hi>ſufficient</hi> that we obeyed them <hi>meerely</hi> becauſe God hath commanded
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170645:119"/>them:
<note place="margin">Act 15.10.</note> the Apoſtles called them a <hi>heavy yoake, which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare:</hi> In calling them a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie yoake, it <hi>demonſtrates</hi> their obedience to them was more becauſe God <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> them, then out of any <hi>inherent</hi> intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall goodneſſe which was in them. In calling them a heavy yoake, it was a ſigne that they obeyed them not out of <hi>love</hi> of the things commanded; but out of <hi>love</hi> of that God who commanded them: They were a <hi>heavïe</hi> yoake, but yet they <hi>bare</hi> it till God <hi>tooke</hi> it off; they were <hi>hard</hi> lawes, but yet they <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to them, till God pleaſed to <hi>repeale</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull them. And indeed, I may call it <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> for their obedience was more out of <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> then delight. And for theſe lawes it was ſufficient that they obeyed them <hi>meerly</hi> becauſe God commanded them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But now the other, thoſe commands and things which were <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>Gods nature,</hi> and were in their <hi>owne</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>good</hi> and holy; thoſe it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obey, <hi>becauſe</hi> God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; but there muſt be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>principle</hi> agreeable to them; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>loving</hi> and cloſing with them,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170645:120"/>which ariſeth from the <hi>ſutableneſſe</hi> of the heart to them. Theſe commands muſt not be eſteemed a <hi>heavie yoake,</hi> not a burden, but a <hi>delight;</hi> and principles of <hi>love</hi> are <hi>required</hi> in the doing of them.</p>
            <p>When I ſay, you are <hi>commanded</hi> to love God, to feare God, honour God; it is not enough you doe this <hi>becauſe</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but there muſt bean <hi>inward</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple bred in us whereby we doe all this: he that <hi>loves</hi> God <hi>meerly</hi> becauſe God hath commanded, &amp;c. he loves not God at all; and if that be all, then if God had not <hi>commanded</hi> he would not doe this. But a Chriſtian is to doe this though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a command to bind him to it. And he fees ſo much <hi>beauty</hi> and lovelineſſe in God, his heart is ſo much <hi>taken</hi> with him, that he muſt needs love him.</p>
            <p>So for <hi>prayer,</hi> it is not enough that he pray <hi>meerely</hi> becauſe God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but he is to goe to dutie out of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> of communion with God; he goes upon <hi>dutie</hi> not as a dutie <hi>commanded:</hi> ſo carnall hearts doe ſay they do, who have no <hi>love</hi> to the duty; but he goes upon it as a <hi>meanes</hi> of converſe and communion with God; and thinks it his <hi>happineſſe</hi> when he can <hi>enioy</hi> a little <hi>communion</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:170645:120"/>with him in a dutie. He goes upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes</hi> with God, not as a <hi>ſervant</hi> to his maſter, but as a <hi>childe</hi> to his father; not as his <hi>dutie,</hi> but as his <hi>nature;</hi> not as his <hi>ſervice</hi> only, but as his <hi>priviledge;</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>acceſſe</hi> to God, and communion with him, as one of the top priviledges of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Indeed Chriſtians are by their <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> by Chriſt free from dutie. But theſe wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are free from <hi>dutie</hi> as our <hi>taske;</hi> for ſo it was a burden to us; we are not like to <hi>day-labourers</hi> in the wayes of God, that are to earne every peny we have at the hands of God; we are free from dutie as our taske.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are free from <hi>dutie</hi> meerly as our <hi>trade:</hi> though we walke in the waies of dutie, yet we walke not in them <hi>meerly</hi> as our trade; for that is not for <hi>love</hi> of the worke, but <hi>love</hi> of the gaines which come in. A Chriſtian will doe <hi>dutie</hi> though he ſee no <hi>gaines</hi> coming in by it, becauſe he loves the worke; the worke is <hi>reward</hi> and wages to him. As a man who <hi>loves</hi> ſinne, whoſe nature is <hi>vaſſalized</hi> to ſinne; he will drinke, and ſinne, though to his utter undoing: ſo a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170645:121"/>godly man he will ſerve God, he will hold up in the <hi>wayes</hi> of obedience, though he find no incomes: ſuch a <hi>ſutableneſſe</hi> there is betweene a godly man and the worke, that he will doe it, though he ſee nothing comes in by it.</p>

We are free from <hi>ſlavery</hi> of ſpirit in duty, and doe duty out of a <hi>childlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of Spirit, where the one he doth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty becauſe of <hi>feare</hi> of blowes, feare of the cudgell: were it not for feare of that, that God would puniſh him, he would not doe the duties.

He counts this his greateſt <hi>puniſhment</hi> to be denied <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with God, converſes with him; this is enough to him. You have a <hi>child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> ſpeech of <hi>Abſolon</hi> will ſerve a little to exemplifie this:
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.34.</note>

The pardoning of his fault was not <hi>apprehended</hi> ſo great a mercy, as the <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:170645:121"/>from his fathers ſight was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a miſery, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Let me ſee his face though he kill me:</hi> he thought no <hi>puniſhment</hi> for his fault to be ſo great an evill, as to be <hi>denied acceſſe</hi> to his father, and communion with him. So it is here with the ſoule, he thinkes this the greateſt <hi>puniſhment</hi> to be denied <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi> to God, and communion with him. Oh this he eſteems the top of miſery, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he be <hi>killed</hi> in communion and <hi>acceſſes</hi> to God, then to enjoy all <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> in the want, and deniall of it: a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart he doth duty becauſe of the puniſhment if he doe not doe it; a holy heart he doth eſteeme this the <hi>top</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to be <hi>denied</hi> communion with him: he eſteemes <hi>acceſſe</hi> to God and communion with him, to be his <hi>top</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou cauſeſt to approach to thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and herein he conceives his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to conſiſt, in <hi>approaches</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170645:122"/>happineſſe enough; his ſpirit doth not act thus, doe thou pray, doe thou obey, and it ſhall goe <hi>well</hi> with thee here, and thou ſhalt have <hi>heaven</hi> hereafter; but he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes this a <hi>piece</hi> of his heaven, to have <hi>communion</hi> with God; this is <hi>coelum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra coelum;</hi> he needs not be <hi>drawne</hi> to it by any <hi>promiſes;</hi> there is enough in the thing it ſelfe, communion with God, to induce him and make his ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it.</p>
            <p>And he goes upon the duty, as a <hi>piece</hi> of reward; which if he can but find God in, and have <hi>converſe</hi> and communion with God in it; Oh there is heaven e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, glory enough to his ſoule.

            <p n="3">3. The one he doth dutie out of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions</hi> of conſcience, the other he doth duty out of the propenſions of Nature.

            <p n="6">6.

So they deſire dutie, and <hi>holineſſe</hi> but onely in a Caſe, they looke upon <hi>prayer,</hi> upon obedience, mortification of their luſts, &amp;c. but as ſo many <hi>hard taskes,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which they muſt <hi>ſubmit</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe if they will come to glory; But the other doth cloſe with theſe as his <hi>heaven,</hi> as a part of his happineſſe, a <hi>piece</hi> of his glory—he doth not cloſe with theſe things out of <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> but out of <hi>delight,</hi> theſe are not his <hi>penance,</hi> but his <hi>glory,</hi> his deſire: As the one he <hi>parts</hi> with ſin, not becauſe it is not <hi>deſireable,</hi> for he weeps after them, but becauſe it is <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he parts with ſin as <hi>Iacob</hi> with <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe he ſhould ſtarve: or as <hi>Phaltiel,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

            <p>All <hi>delight</hi> in duties doth ariſe from a <hi>ſutableneſſe</hi> of ſpirit in the doing of them, if there be not <hi>grace</hi> within, as well as <hi>dutie</hi> without, if there be not <hi>principles</hi> agreeable to <hi>precepts,</hi> the heart can never delight in them.

            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of God which is in the booke is <hi>tranſcribed</hi> into his heart, it is his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> his new <hi>nature;</hi> ſo that hee <hi>acts</hi> his owne nature renewed, in <hi>acting</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The eye needs no command to ſee, or the eare to heare, it is their nature, the command is in it ſelf, the <hi>facultie</hi> of ſeeing is the command to ſee: ſo far as the heart is <hi>renewed</hi> it is as <hi>naturall</hi> for it to obey, as for the <hi>eye</hi> to ſee, the ear to hear; and to <hi>live</hi> in obedience, as the <hi>fiſh</hi> in the water, the bird in the ayre.</p>
            <p>And therefore we do not obey <hi>meerly,</hi>

               <hi>Actions</hi> of nature they are <hi>actions</hi> of

            <p>And ſo we ſhall <hi>anſwer</hi> this in two concluſions.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>free-man</hi> of Chriſt,

He ſhall never more be a <hi>ſervant</hi> to ſinne, the promiſe is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>You are not under the law, but under grace; therefore ſin ſhall have no more dominion over you.</hi> Sin may have a <hi>tyranny,</hi> but never a <hi>ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> you may be carried <hi>captive,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. — <hi>leading me captive</hi> — but you ſhall not be <hi>willing</hi> captives; you may <hi>fall</hi> into ſinne, but you ſhall never be <hi>ſervants</hi> to ſinne more; your eares ſhall never be <hi>boared</hi> in token of <hi>willing</hi> and voluntary <hi>ſubiection</hi> to ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, he ſhall never be a <hi>ſlave</hi> to Satan more, Satan may get the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:170645:129"/>of him, but he ſhall never become his <hi>willing</hi> ſervant more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So he ſhall never come <hi>under</hi> the <hi>law</hi> more. 1. Not under the <hi>rigour</hi> of it. 2. Not under the <hi>curſe</hi> of it; the law can take no hold of him to condemnation. And this is the ground, he <hi>is not under the law, but under grace;</hi> if he can <hi>ſinne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from <hi>under</hi> grace, then <hi>indeed</hi> he is againe <hi>under</hi> all this: But this is <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> therefore the other; and ſo much for the firſt.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>freemen</hi> of Chriſt cannot <hi>ſinne</hi> themſelves into a <hi>ſtate</hi> of bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, into an <hi>univerſall</hi> bondage;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſion. </seg>2</label> yet may they ſinne themſelves into a <hi>graduall</hi> partiall bondage, which we will ſhew in two particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>freeman</hi> of Chriſt may <hi>ſinne himſelfe</hi> into a <hi>bondage</hi> in reſpect of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Thus you ſee <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Reſtore to me the ioyes of thy ſalvation:</hi> men that will not <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>direction</hi> of the Spirit, ſhall <hi>want</hi> the <hi>conſolation</hi> of the Spirit; if they will doe <hi>workes</hi> of darkeneſſe, they muſt looke to <hi>walke</hi> in darkeneſſe. Though promiſes of <hi>grace</hi> are abſolute, yet promiſes of <hi>peace</hi> and comfort ſeeme to be conditionall, not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170645:130"/>that our <hi>walking</hi> hath any <hi>meriting</hi> or deſerving power to the <hi>procuring</hi> of our peace: but that this is the way in which God will beſtow it, and continue our peace and comfort. In the waies of dutie we hold up our <hi>communion</hi> with God, our <hi>converſes</hi> with him, our <hi>actings</hi> of faith and grace; and ſo in theſe <hi>waies comfort</hi> and peace as they are <hi>procured,</hi> ſo are they continued. Grace is as the <hi>fire,</hi> comfort as the <hi>flame</hi> that comes from it; but as it is with <hi>greene wood,</hi> if it be not continually <hi>blowing,</hi> there will be no <hi>flame;</hi> ſo <hi>grace</hi> is in us, as <hi>fire</hi> in greene <hi>wood,</hi> which will quickly gather an <hi>aſh</hi> and deadneſſe, if you doe not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in <hi>blowing,</hi> if you doe not <hi>exerciſe</hi> your graces, you can looke for no flame, looke for no comfort without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faith, of grace, and ſutable walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in obedience. Though promiſes of grace are abſolute, yet promiſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I ſay, they are conditionall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>To him that ordereth his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi> Iſa. 32.17. <hi>The worke of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſſe ſhall be quietneſſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever.</hi> Iſa. 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170645:130"/>him that reioyceth and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, him that remembers thee in thy way, &amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 14.15, 16, 21. <hi>If you love me, keepe my Commandements, and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, who ſhall abide with you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>He that hath my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and keepeth them, is he that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelfe to him.</hi> Where you ſee it ſeemes all to lie upon condition: ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As many as walke according to this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, and upon the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> So that if men <hi>walke</hi> not in the wayes of <hi>obedience,</hi> they may <hi>want</hi> comfort, they may <hi>want</hi> peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>freemen</hi> of Chriſt may <hi>ſinne</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a <hi>bondage by ſinne,</hi> though not into the bondage <hi>of ſinne:</hi> They may ſin themſelves into a <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>feare;</hi> yea and a bondage of <hi>trouble;</hi> their ſinne may coſt them <hi>brokenneſſe</hi> of bones, though they ſhall not ſinne themſelves into a ſtate-bondage againe. Though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>ſinne</hi> away your <hi>grace,</hi> yet you may ſinne away the <hi>evidence,</hi> the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>comfort</hi> of it: Though you cannot ſinne
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170645:131"/>away your <hi>pardon,</hi> yet you may ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it; nay the <hi>comforts</hi> of it; though you have it, yet you have no <hi>comfort</hi> from it; it is as though you had no pardon in <hi>reſpect</hi> of you; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you muſt ſay a man may have <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of peace, of aſſurance, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort even in the <hi>higheſt</hi> acts of ſinne, as ſome have ſaid. Nay, and you may not onely <hi>ſinne</hi> away the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and comfort of it, but the <hi>evidence</hi> and knowledge of it; as that place of <hi>Peter</hi> ſeemes to imply, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſinnes;</hi> new ſinnes bring new feares, new guilts and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: All the former foundations and reſting places of the ſoule ſeeme to be ſhaken, new doubts ariſe whether I am juſtified and pardoned, yea, or no; and theſe new doubts bring new troubles and feares on the ſoule.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay this is our <hi>weakneſſe,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the former it is our <hi>weakneſſe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ſo is the other, but yet with much difference, for in this it is a <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> which we have <hi>contracted</hi> on our ſelves, or a weakneſſe <hi>inflicted</hi> in chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of former <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> as it was in <hi>David,</hi> his ſinne had brought this on him.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Though it be our <hi>work</hi> to beleeve,

            <p>In a word, I conceive wee may <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> between the <hi>foundation</hi> and being of a Chriſtians peace, and the <hi>flouriſhing</hi> and

But the <hi>flouriſhing</hi> and wel-being of this peace doth much <hi>depend</hi> upon the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of our Graces, and exact <hi>walking</hi> with God. It is <hi>purchaſed</hi> by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of another, but muſt be <hi>cheriſhed</hi> by our owne obedience: And indeed it doth ſo far <hi>depend</hi> on us, that if we do not walk <hi>exactly,</hi> though we cannot ſinne away our <hi>former pardon,</hi> yet we may ſinne away our <hi>preſent peace.</hi> There is a 5. <hi>fold peace</hi> that a man may ſinne away, the leaſt of which is worth a world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>peace</hi> which flowes from the <hi>witneſ</hi>-bearing of our conſcience in our <hi>integrity</hi> and exact walking, ſuch a peace as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had when he ſaid, <hi>Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how I have walked before thee in ſinceritie</hi> — and <hi>Paul</hi> had the ſame, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. and that <hi>peace</hi> we may ſinne away, when wee fall into <hi>freſh ſin,</hi> the <hi>comforts</hi> of our former walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not beare us up.</p>
            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:170645:134"/>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>peace</hi> which flowes from the ſouls <hi>Communion</hi> and converſes with God in dutie. There is <hi>peace</hi> as well as <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> in every <hi>peice</hi> of holineſſe, and this <hi>peace</hi> a man may ſinne away. All that <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> and adaptation of ſpirit in duty is now gone upon freſh <hi>revolts</hi> into ſin, and now the ſoul formerly <hi>comforted,</hi> is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and <hi>diſturbed</hi> in all its <hi>approaches</hi> and converſes with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>peace</hi> which flowes from the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of Grace <hi>implanted</hi> in you: you cannot <hi>exerciſe</hi> any Grace, but there is ſome <hi>peace</hi> and comfort in the exerciſe of it. When you exerciſe your <hi>faith</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and cloſe with Chriſt, your <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to mourne for ſin, — there is ſome peace, ſome <hi>comfort,</hi> that is the <hi>reſult</hi> of theſe exerciſes. Now a man may <hi>ſinne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this comfort, your <hi>freſh ſinne</hi> doth <hi>wound</hi> and diſturb you in the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of your Graces, and therefore your <hi>comforts</hi> which flow from ſuch <hi>exerciſes</hi> muſt needs be interrupted. Nay if a man may <hi>ſinne away</hi> ſome meaſures and degrees of Grace, thoſe <hi>meaſures</hi> which are gotten of a mans owne <hi>improvement,</hi> much more may he <hi>ſinne</hi> away his <hi>peace</hi> which ſhould flow from them.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:170645:135"/>
            <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>peace</hi> which flowes from the ſenſe &amp; knowledge <hi>of Gods grace</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the ſoul, when a man is able to <hi>evidence</hi> the <hi>works</hi> of Grace implanted in the ſoule, there muſt needs be peace and comfort in it. Now this alſo a man may <hi>ſinne</hi> away, he may ſin away the ſenſe and knowledge of a work of Grace in him, he may ſo <hi>darken</hi> and obſcure his evidences by ſin, that he is not able to <hi>read</hi> them, nor <hi>diſcerne</hi> that worke of Grace in him, hee may now finde ſo much grace as to <hi>afflict</hi> him, but not ſo much as to <hi>comfort</hi> him, his light was not <hi>directive</hi> before, and it is <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive</hi> now.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a <hi>peace</hi> which flowes from the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of God at peace with the ſoule: A peace which flowes from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Gods favour, from the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of God at peace with us. And this peace may we <hi>forfeit</hi> and loſe, though we cannot ſinne away our <hi>former pardon,</hi> yet may we ſinne away our <hi>preſent peace;</hi> nay and ſin away the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>comfort;</hi> yea the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our former pardon; which may be implied in that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſerve for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170645:135"/>to the Objections, and the <hi>ſettling</hi> of the firſt particular, that the <hi>freemen</hi> of Chriſt may ſin themſelves into bondage in <hi>reſpect</hi> of comfort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian may ſinne himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>bondage</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>manner</hi> of his obedience: Though he doe <hi>now</hi> ſerve God, yet not with that <hi>meaſure</hi> of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe; not with that <hi>meaſure</hi> of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, chearfulneſſe, and <hi>delight;</hi> not with that inlargedneſſe of heart which <hi>former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he hath done. <hi>David</hi> after his ſinne deſired that he might have the <hi>free</hi> Spirit of God <hi>reſtored</hi> to him; he had not <hi>loſt it,</hi> the free <hi>ſpirit</hi> was in him; but he <hi>wanted</hi> that former <hi>freedome</hi> of ſpirit; he wanted thoſe <hi>operations</hi> and workings of it; he wanted that comfort in <hi>ſervice,</hi> and that freedom to <hi>ſervice</hi> which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the wheels were now taken off, and he went <hi>heavily,</hi> and ſadly on in the waies of life.

            <p>There are two other <hi>opinions</hi> which are to be debated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some ſay <hi>peremptorily,</hi> that we
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170645:138"/>muſt have no <hi>eye,</hi> nor no <hi>reſpect</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or <hi>glory</hi> in our obedience: But we muſt <hi>walke</hi> in all the <hi>wayes</hi> of obedience, with this <hi>freedome;</hi> carrying no <hi>reſpect</hi> to the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward at all: and that it is utterly <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>free</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Chriſtian, and <hi>deſtructive</hi> to our Chriſtian freedome, to doe <hi>duty</hi> with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> to reward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a third opinion, that ſaith, we may <hi>doe</hi> holy <hi>actions,</hi> and we may walke in the <hi>wayes</hi> of obedience; and may alſo in this <hi>doing</hi> caſt an eye, and have <hi>reſpect</hi> to the <hi>recompence</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Theſe two laſt come to be <hi>examined</hi> by us; we have <hi>caſt out</hi> the firſt, as <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>nature</hi> of grace, and the <hi>freedom</hi> of the Goſpel; but both theſe two are held up as <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with grace and Chriſtian freedome. And yet theſe two laſt ſeeme to ſtand upon <hi>oppoſite</hi> tearmes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One ſaith, we are to <hi>doe</hi> holy <hi>duties,</hi> and may not at all caſt an <hi>eye</hi> to the <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ſaith, we may have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> to the recompence of <hi>reward</hi> in the doing of them.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, that we are not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170645:138"/>to have <hi>respect</hi> to the <hi>recompence</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: It ſeemes to be <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> by theſe arguments or reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this <hi>overthrowes</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our <hi>obedience,</hi> and makes that <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary</hi> and ſervile, which ſhould be <hi>ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> and free; for if we doe obey God in <hi>reference</hi> to heaven and glory, then we doe not obey <hi>freely,</hi> not God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but <hi>ſervilely,</hi> and mercenarily, that obedience being <hi>ſervile</hi> in the principle which is <hi>mercenarie</hi> in the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe if ſo; then we overthrow the <hi>nature</hi> of grace, and make that mans <hi>purchaſe</hi> which yet is <hi>freely beſtowed</hi> of God, which muſt needs overthrow the nature of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe all theſe things they are the <hi>parts</hi> of the Covenant made to us: I will <hi>pardon</hi> your ſinnes, I will give you <hi>grace,</hi> I will give you glory. Now we doe not obey that we may have <hi>pardon;</hi> nor obey that we may have <hi>grace;</hi> and why the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? why ſhould we ſay, that we obey, that we may have <hi>glory,</hi> ſeeing theſe are alike promiſed?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe all theſe are fully <hi>purchaſed</hi> by Ieſus Chriſt, and <hi>provided</hi> for in Chriſt. Therefore they are not the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of us:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170645:139"/>we doe not obey, that we may get this, but becauſe theſe are <hi>purchaſed</hi> for us, and we are <hi>perſwaded</hi> thereof, therefore we doe obey, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus may the firſt Opinion be managed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond, that we may have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> to the recompence of the <hi>reward</hi> in our obedience.</p>
            <p>It may be thus managed and defended.</p>
            <p>That which God hath <hi>propounded</hi> as an <hi>incentive</hi> to obedience,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>1</label> we may look upon in our obedience. But this God hath ſo <hi>propounded: Ergo.</hi> Or thus.

But motives may be taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to quicken us in our obedience. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>propoſition</hi> ſeemes the <hi>main</hi> to be cleared; and it is proved thus.</p>
            <p>That which God hath uſed as a <hi>motive</hi> to quicken to obedience,

            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man under the <hi>law,</hi> and he had not ſo <hi>free</hi> a ſpirit in <hi>ſervice,</hi> as thoſe now under the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But to this may be anſwered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a <hi>ſonne,</hi> though under age, and had the <hi>free ſpirit</hi> of grace; elſe he could have had no glory.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

You ſee <hi>Paul</hi> who had as <hi>free</hi> &amp; ingenuous <hi>principles</hi> in him as ever man had; yet he ſaith of himſelfe, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>I forget all things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſſe hard to the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the ſeverall <hi>opinions,</hi> and and the chiefe <hi>ſtrength</hi> whereon they ſtand.</p>
            <p>Now in way of <hi>reconciliation,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170645:140"/>downe that which I <hi>apprehend</hi> the truth in this Controverſie:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will firſt ſhew what is meant by <hi>reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What by eyeing of the reward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the <hi>eyeing</hi> of it be any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement</hi> to Chriſtian freedome.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, what is meant by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Rewards may be ſaid to be of a <hi>threefold</hi> nature. 1. Temporall. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. 3. Eternall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Temporall,</hi> and thoſe are all kinde of <hi>mercies</hi> we enjoy in this life, whether <hi>perſonall,</hi> or <hi>relative,</hi> and thoſe <hi>poſitive,</hi> or <hi>privative,</hi> health, comfort, food, rayment, houſe, harbour, riches, freedome, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. —</p>
            <p n="2">2. Spirituall, and thoſe are all kinde of <hi>bleſsings</hi> concerne the <hi>ſoule:</hi> Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification, Grace, increaſe of grace, victory over our luſts, comfort, peace, joy, communion with God. —</p>
            <p n="3">3. Eternall <hi>rewards,</hi> and that is the maine in controverſie; <hi>glory, immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, life,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſets it down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. <hi>Who will render to every man according to his works, to them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing ſeeke for glory, and honour, and immortalitie, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170645:141"/>life.</hi> In a word, this eternall <hi>reward</hi> is the <hi>enioyment</hi> of God, of Chriſt, of the Spirit, it is perfect <hi>freedome</hi> from ſinne, it is perfect <hi>holineſſe,</hi> it is indeed, grace <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> this is that eternall reward. And this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is meant by <hi>Eying</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It is the phraſe which the Apoſtle uſeth of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>He eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then all the treaſures of Egypt, for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> We will a little explaine what is meant by it.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>threefold</hi> eye.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man ſees and <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>excellency</hi> of a thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> whereby he beleeves the <hi>truth</hi> of it, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An eye of <hi>hope,</hi> and thereupon of patience, and waiting or <hi>expectation</hi> for the injoyment of it.</p>
            <p>In theſe <hi>reſpects, Moſes</hi> might be ſaid to <hi>eye</hi> the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He <hi>eyed</hi> it by knowledge, he <hi>knew</hi> thoſe things which were <hi>laid</hi> up for him, he ſaw him that was <hi>inviſible,</hi> as the next verſe tels us; and <hi>he</hi> ſaw thoſe <hi>rewards</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:170645:141"/>which God had laid up for his people, farre to be preferred before the pleaſures of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He had an <hi>eye</hi> of Faith; Whereby he was <hi>perſwaded</hi> both of the truth of it, that ſuch things were <hi>reſerved,</hi> and of his part in them, and that he ſhould <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> this glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He had an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> to wait and expect the enjoyment of all this with patience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36.</p>
            <p>And now hereupon he <hi>eſteemed</hi> the <hi>reproach</hi> of Chriſt above all the <hi>treaſures</hi> of Egypt, for ſaith the Text: <hi>He had an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi> What's that? ſhall we ſay, he had <hi>reſpect</hi> to that glory which hee ſhould <hi>purchaſe</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, by doing of this, or for doing this. No. But becauſe he knew the <hi>glory</hi> that was <hi>reſerved</hi> for him, becauſe he did <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> that he ſhould poſſeſſe it, becauſe he did <hi>hope</hi> for it, and expect it. Therefore he did <hi>deſpiſe</hi> all the riches and pleaſures of the world, as not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it. Agreeable to which are thoſe places, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. And thus much for the ſecond, we come now to the third.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether to doe duties with an <hi>eye,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:170645:142"/>to the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward be any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement</hi> to our Chriſtian freedome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, if you take it thus as I have ſaid, for <hi>knowing, beleeving, hoping;</hi> expecting of that glory God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to us; then I ſay, it is no <hi>infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of Chriſtian libertie, to doe duties with an eye to the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But rather contrary I ſay, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our <hi>liberty</hi> doth conſiſt, upon <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> faith, perſwaſion, hope, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that <hi>glory,</hi> which God hath <hi>reſerved</hi> for us, <hi>thereupon</hi> to be <hi>incouraged</hi> and quickened in our obedience, and thereby made <hi>free</hi> indeed in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him.</p>
            <p>In briefe then if you take this <hi>eyeing</hi> of the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward as I have ſaid, then a man may doe <hi>duties</hi> with an eye to the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward. And indeed we ought to doe them with ſuch an eye to the recompence of reward. 1. Vpon knowledge, faith, perſwaſion, that God will bleſſe us, and never depart from us, from doing us good. 2. And upon knowledge, faith, perſwaſion, that God is our Father, that our ſinnes are pardoned, &amp;c. 3. And upon the like knowledge, faith and perſwaſion that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170645:142"/>God will glorifie us at laſt, thereupon we are to obey &amp; <hi>give</hi> up our ſelves to all the <hi>wayes</hi> of obedience, love and ſervice of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>And what ever you doe, doe heartily to the Lord, knowing that of the Lord you ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance.</hi> But if by <hi>eyeing</hi> of the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you meane thus, whether we are not to <hi>doe</hi> duties, in <hi>reference</hi> to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> of ſpirituall, temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mercies, then I muſt <hi>pauſe,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you by ſome diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>queſtion</hi> be demanded, 1. of temporall good things. <hi>Whether may not</hi> a <hi>man do duties and obey God in</hi> reference <hi>to Gods beſtowing of outward mercies and inioyments upon him in this life.</hi> The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative whereof, <hi>viz:</hi> (that a man may <hi>obey</hi> God with an <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> to Gods <hi>beſtowing</hi> of outward mercies, and good things in this life) is held up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by holy and learned men, ſuch as I beleeve doe <hi>carry</hi> as little eye to theſe things as any doe, in their obedience. And this is <hi>maintained</hi> upon the former grounds, becauſe God hath propounded theſe things as <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>incentives</hi> to obedience, and the <hi>beſt of Saints</hi> have <hi>eyed</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:170645:143"/>them in their obedience, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we may do it alſo. And to take off all ſuſpicion of <hi>mercinarineſſe</hi> of ſpirit in ſo doing, they uſe to diſtinguiſh betweene <hi>Supreame</hi> grounds and ends, &amp; <hi>Subordinate</hi> grounds and ends, and ſay, though the <hi>things</hi> of this life may be the <hi>Subordinate</hi> ground and end of our ſervice, yet they are not to be the <hi>ultimate</hi> and Supreame grounds or ends of ſervice.
<note place="margin">Matt. 6.33.</note> We may eye them with <hi>reference</hi> and ſubordination to Gods glory and our good and ſalvation, but not <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> before, or <hi>ſupreamely</hi> above the glory of God and our ſalvation: Theſe are the uſuall <hi>cautionall</hi> diſtinctions which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch as <hi>affirme</hi> the poſition.</p>
            <p>I reverence their perſons <hi>and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and what I ſpeak though it may be <hi>different,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe it will not be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to that which hath been maintained by them.</p>
            <p>The Query is, <hi>Whether a man may not doe duties and obey God, in reference to Gods beſtowing temporall good things on him.</hi> For the right ſtating of the <hi>Query,</hi> I conceive firſt, that <hi>(man)</hi> in the <hi>Query,</hi> muſt be taken for <hi>Chriſtian man,</hi> or <hi>man in Chriſt;</hi> for if it be ſpoken of <hi>Carnall man,</hi> he doth neither <hi>obey</hi> from right <hi>principles,</hi> upon

            <p>And therefore by [Man] in the <hi>Query,</hi> I conceive is meant [Chriſtian Man] or Man in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By [good things] here I conceive is meant, <hi>outward</hi> good things, and thoſe ſuch as the <hi>world</hi> doe reckon and eſteeme to be <hi>good things,</hi> as riches, honour, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, applauſe; at leaſt, a <hi>competency</hi> and ſufficiency of <hi>temporall</hi> and outward good things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And by [ſerving God] I conceive is meant all the <hi>acts</hi> of obedience, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outward <hi>conformitie,</hi> but inward <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</hi> to the <hi>lawes</hi> and commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And by [eying] of theſe <hi>temporall</hi> good things in ſervice, I conceive, is not meant the <hi>making</hi> theſe things either the <hi>meere</hi> or <hi>maine</hi> grounds of his obedience, nor the <hi>ſupreame</hi> and primary <hi>ends</hi> and aymes of his ſervice, for that were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, but carrying a <hi>reſpect</hi> unto the <hi>inioyment</hi> of theſe things, as a ſubordinate ground to ſet him on worke, and a means to <hi>quicken</hi> him in working. And thus I have rendred the beſt ſenſe I can, of thoſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170645:144"/>particulars in the Query, and the queſtion being thus ſtated; I ſhall now come to the Anſwer. In which I conceive I ſhall have the grant of three particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>inioyment</hi> of theſe good things of this life, is not the <hi>ground</hi> of a Chriſtian mans obedience; they are not that which doth put us on worke, though they ſhould be <hi>admitted</hi> to quicken us in working, they are not the <hi>ſpring</hi> of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the moſt they are but <hi>oyle</hi> to the wheeles to keep on and <hi>quicken</hi> motion. I conceive there are theſe <hi>grounds</hi> of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>binding</hi> grounds: and thoſe are becauſe God hath commanded, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts, oh that my heart were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to keep thy ſtatutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>inabling</hi> grounds. Thoſe are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our <hi>implantation</hi> into Chriſt; As <hi>without him we can doe nothing,</hi> ſo <hi>in him we are created to all good works, and I can doe all things through Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts <hi>implantation</hi> into us, which is called the <hi>forming</hi> of Chriſt in the ſoul, the <hi>new</hi> man, the law <hi>written</hi> in the heart,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170645:145"/>the <hi>new</hi> creatures, faith &amp; love, whereby we are inabled to obey his precepts: our faith <hi>inables.</hi> By faith <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed — and our love conſtraines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impelling</hi> grounds, and thoſe are motives rather; 1. becauſe <hi>God</hi> is good, 2. becauſe he hath been <hi>good</hi> to us. Gods goodneſſe is a motive, and his grace is our ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>inioyment</hi> of theſe things, they are not the <hi>meere</hi> end of a Chriſtians obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then would it <hi>render</hi> us to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and <hi>mercenary</hi> in our obedience, and not <hi>Son-like</hi> and free. Indeed theſe may be the <hi>meere ends</hi> of the <hi>obedience</hi> of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, but not of the godly, they have <hi>higher</hi> ends then theſe: Theſe are too low for the noble and <hi>royall</hi> ſpirits of Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are not the <hi>main</hi> ends of their obedience, they have <hi>higher</hi> ends then theſe are; A Chriſtian hath a more <hi>noble</hi> ſpirit, a more <hi>free-borne</hi> ſoule, then to make any <hi>thing</hi> out of God himſelfe, the <hi>maine</hi> end of his obedience to God. And ſo farre all agree.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>controverſie</hi> is about the next, which I deſire to <hi>propound</hi> in modeſty, to thoſe who are of <hi>different</hi> judgements.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:170645:145"/>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it can be ſaid to be the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> end of a Chriſtians obedience Seeing,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſeemes to bee the <hi>paedagogy</hi> of the Law, in which time they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>carryed</hi> by temporall promiſes in the wayes of obedience, and God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>propound</hi> to them as men under age, the promiſes of <hi>temporall</hi> good things to <hi>tempt</hi> them on to obedience. As you ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. Certainly, the injoyment of theſe temporall things was not the <hi>meere</hi> end of their obedience; though ſome of them might have the ſpirit of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who ſaid, they <hi>kept</hi> the Law, and obſerved it, that God might <hi>bleſſe</hi> them, and that it might goe well with them in this life; yet <hi>all</hi> were not of this ſpirit: nor was the injoyment of theſe things, the <hi>maine</hi> end of their obedience no more then of ours: It was but a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> end, God never <hi>propounded</hi> it, nor did the godly <hi>eye</hi> it, as the <hi>maine</hi> end of their obedience. But God deales with them as in their <hi>infancy,</hi> as under age, and leads them on, and <hi>allures</hi> them by ſuch <hi>reſpects</hi> as theſe; becauſe they had not that <hi>meaſure</hi> and abundance of ſpirit
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170645:146"/>which hee hath <hi>beſtowed</hi> on his people now under the Goſpel.</p>

            <p n="6">6.

It ſeemes better to ſay, that we are not to obey that God may <hi>beſtow</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on us, but rather upon the <hi>knowledge,</hi> faith, perſwaſion of Gods bleſſing of us here and for ever, to be <hi>quickned</hi> from that to obey him. And the Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeake after the ſame manner to us,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170645:146"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> He argues from mercy to dutie, not from dutie to mercy here. He reaſons here from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of promiſes to the performance of obedience; <hi>having therefore ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, let us obey.</hi> So in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>And whatſoever you doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord, and not to man; Knowing that of the Lord you ſhall receive the reward of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:</hi> where you ſee he takes up the <hi>argument,</hi> to inforce the <hi>dutie</hi> from the knowledge, or faith and perſwaſion of that reward which God will <hi>aſſuredly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on them. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They tooke ioyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves that they had in heaven, a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> But I am not here to deale with <hi>eternall,</hi> but with <hi>temporall</hi> rewards, and urge theſe places no further then to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> what I ſaid before, that it ſeemes better to ſay, that we doe not <hi>obey</hi> that God may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow theſe outward <hi>bleſſings</hi> on us, but rather upon the <hi>knowledge,</hi> faith, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods <hi>bleſsing</hi> us here, and for ever, we are <hi>quickned</hi> to obey him, and in our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170645:147"/>obedience of him. And certainly the leſſe <hi>eye</hi> that we carry to theſe things <hi>in</hi> our obedience, the more eye will God <hi>carry</hi> to our obedience, the leſſe <hi>regard</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect you have to theſe outward things in your ſervice, the more will God <hi>reſpect</hi> &amp; regard your ſervice, the leſſe you make them the <hi>end</hi> of your working, the more will God make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>end</hi> of your work; Indeed the injoyment of <hi>outward</hi> things ſeeme to be too <hi>low</hi> for a Chriſtian to eye them in his obedience, the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>We looke not at the things which are ſeene, but at the things which are not ſeene: for the things which are ſeene are temporall, but the things which are not ſeene are eternall.</hi>

            <p>If <hi>good things</hi> be taken at large <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,</hi> the firſt part of the <hi>Obiection</hi> is granted; that God hath promiſed to the <hi>obedient,</hi> or to the <hi>obedient</hi> in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <hi>Through many tribulations wee muſt enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe tells us, <hi>That if we will follow him, we muſt take up our croſſe daily and follow him.</hi> — Luke 9.23.
<note place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note> And therefore certainly if by the <hi>promiſe</hi> of this life, be meant the <hi>good things</hi> of this life: and if by <hi>the good things</hi> of this life, be meant <hi>outward inioyments,</hi> then I ſay there is no ſuch promiſe made here to obedience.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>If you will be willing and obedient, you ſhall eate the good of the Land.</hi> And therefore temporall bleſſings are <hi>promiſed</hi> upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of obedience.</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>admitted</hi> that the Iews (though they were under a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace) were yet under a <hi>different</hi> Covenant from us: a <hi>ſubſervient</hi> covenant, as I have ſhewed, wherein God <hi>promiſed</hi> outward mercies to <hi>obedience;</hi> and threatened <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> to the diſobedient: then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is ſoone made: — And <hi>David</hi> might well ſay, <hi>Hee never ſaw the righteous forſaken; nor their ſeed begging

            </p>
            <p>And where is it that God hath made ſuch a <hi>promiſe</hi> now under the Goſpel?

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170645:153"/>us, and are <hi>good</hi> for us, they are not the <hi>grounds</hi> of our obedience, though they ſhould come in as <hi>incouragements</hi> in our obedience; they are not the <hi>ſpring,</hi> though the <hi>oyle;</hi> they are not the grounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though we ſhould <hi>admit</hi> them to come in as <hi>helps</hi> in motion; and if not the aſſurance of them, then how can the hopes of them which are more uncertain, be laid downe as the ground of our obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? though the <hi>ground</hi> of this <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> act of obedience, yet ſurely not the <hi>ſpring</hi> of the whole.

            <p>We come now to the ſecond branch of the Query propounded, <hi>viz. Whether we are not to doe duties with reference and revpect to the obtaining of ſpirituall good things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are ſome that ſay,
<note place="margin">Doct. <hi>C.</hi> in his Chriſt alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, pag. 300, 301, 302, 303, &amp;c.—</note> We are not to <hi>propound</hi> any reſpects or <hi>ends</hi> at all in the doing of <hi>duty:</hi> by which they doe not meane <hi>baſe</hi> ends, or <hi>carnall</hi> reſpects, or <hi>ſecular</hi> advantages: but they intend

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe we muſt not thinke to <hi>purchaſe</hi> that by our prayers and <hi>duties</hi> which is the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of Chriſt; But Chriſt hath fully <hi>purchaſed</hi> all this for us, <hi>viz. pardon,</hi> peace, joy, and every good thing. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe all theſe are ſufficiently <hi>provided</hi> for us in Chriſt: and God hath <hi>decreed</hi> all theſe good things for us in Chriſt; and therefore we muſt not think to <hi>compaſſe</hi> them by our prayers.</p>

            <p>Certainly I need not ſay much againſt the <hi>opinion,</hi> for if it be but twice <hi>repeated</hi> it will be as good as a <hi>confutation</hi> to it—. Indeed if this be a <hi>truth,</hi> we muſt have <hi>another Bible</hi> to countenance it: What is more frequent then this?

And what can be more <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>grace,</hi> to <hi>reaſon,</hi> then ſuch an opinion? It would be no more <hi>abſurdity</hi> to reaſon, to ſay, we muſt not
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170645:154"/>eate to ſatisfie our hunger; drinke to quench our thirſt; feed to nouriſh our ſelves: but we are to feed out of meere <hi>inſtinct,</hi> and then as <hi>beaſts;</hi> and not out of <hi>reaſon,</hi> as we are men. But what, are we to <hi>doe duty</hi> for no end? may we not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi> ſinne that we may be <hi>humbled,</hi> and made ſenſible of it? may we not <hi>heare</hi> the Word, that our <hi>underſtandings</hi> may be bettered, our <hi>affections</hi> quickened, our <hi>faith</hi> ſtrengthened? Sure they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves propound theſe <hi>ends</hi> in their <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> otherwiſe why doe they take ſo much <hi>paines</hi> to <hi>perſwade</hi> (I doe not ſay, convince) mens <hi>underſtandings</hi> that they are in an error? And may we not uſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> for the <hi>increaſe</hi> of our graces? for the <hi>abatement</hi> and weakening of our corruptions? And may we not do <hi>works</hi> of charitie, to <hi>refreſh</hi> the poore? to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> them who are in extremities? And are not theſe <hi>ends?</hi> And are not the other <hi>duties?</hi> But if all this ſhould be <hi>denied,</hi> yet this you will <hi>grant,</hi> that we may <hi>do duty,</hi> and walke in the wayes of obedience, to <hi>adorne</hi> our profeſſion, to <hi>dignifie</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to <hi>glorifie</hi> God, to <hi>benefit</hi> the Saints, to <hi>winne</hi> others: and are not theſe <hi>ends?</hi> and were not theſe as much <hi>purchaſed</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170645:155"/>by Chriſt, and <hi>provided</hi> for by God as the other? Sure much more God hath no <hi>need</hi> of us, though we have of him; his <hi>glory,</hi> his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> his <hi>cauſe</hi> doth not <hi>depend</hi> upon us: God could <hi>advance</hi> this, and <hi>maintaine</hi> the other without us: and therefore how <hi>little</hi> of men, how little of God, how little of <hi>reaſon,</hi> how little of <hi>Scripture</hi> there is in ſuch a <hi>tenent,</hi> I leave to all to judge.</p>
            <p>But yet that their <hi>ſhew</hi> of reaſons may not goe without an <hi>anſwer,</hi> I ſhall ſay, and it is all I ſhall ſay, to them in a word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though Chriſt have <hi>purchaſed</hi> all good things for us, yet will God beſtow them in a way of <hi>ſeeking:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.37.</note> you ſee this in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. which is <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> at the foot of the moſt <hi>free and abſolute</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>yet I will be inquired to concerning this,</hi>— though God promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all this, and promiſed like himſelfe to beſtow all this <hi>freely</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to man,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 32.</note> as he tels them <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes, be it knowne unto you, Oh houſe of Iſrael, will I doe this.</hi> No, it was for his owne <hi>Names</hi> ſake. And yet he tels them, <hi>I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to doe it for them,</hi>— which plainly ſhewes that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170645:155"/>though God had <hi>promiſed,</hi> and promiſed freely to <hi>beſtow</hi> theſe things on them, yet will he <hi>beſtow</hi> them in a way of <hi>ſeeking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſay yet again, that though God will <hi>beſtow</hi> theſe things in a way of <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> yet they are not the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> of our prayers, but the <hi>gift</hi> of his own mercy, And I <hi>appeale</hi> to any, whether ever they heard any <hi>conſcientious Miniſter</hi> to ſay, that prayer was the <hi>meriting</hi> cauſe of any mercy.

Here were good <hi>affections,</hi> but it will <hi>appear</hi> before I have done, that certainly here wanted clear <hi>conceptions</hi> of heaven &amp; glory, if ſhe had <hi>conceived aright</hi> of that, there had not needed this <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> There is nothing in heaven that a

               <hi>glorified</hi> ſoule can tel how to <hi>part</hi> withall: there is nothing to be burned up there; there is nothing but <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> and in <hi>Glorie,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>As 1. though we may have <hi>reſpect</hi> to heaven and glory &amp; our ſalvation, yet theſe muſt not be the <hi>ſupream</hi> and <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> reſpects, but onely <hi>ſecondary</hi> and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior reſpects.</p>

            <p>And yet ſome there are who <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> betweene <hi>young</hi> beginners, and <hi>growne</hi> Chriſtians. At the firſt <hi>entrance</hi> of a ſoule into the <hi>wayes</hi> of Grace, ſay they, a man <hi>lookes</hi> upon <hi>heaven</hi> and hell; the one to <hi>drive</hi> him out of ſinne, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>perſwade</hi> him, and draw him into the waies of holineſſe: but when once a ſoule is <hi>entered</hi> into the wayes of life, he finds ſo much <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> in God, and his wayes, that now he <hi>ſerves</hi> him with a more free and ingenuous ſpirit. As the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.41, 42.</note> 
               <hi>Now we beleeve, not becauſe thou haſt ſaid it, but becauſe we have heard him, and know this is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias that ſhould come,</hi> Ioh. 4 41, 42. So now we <hi>ſerve</hi> thee, not for <hi>feare</hi> of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>hope</hi> of reward; but becauſe we ſee thoſe <hi>beauties</hi> in thy ſelfe, that <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in thy waies, that if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heaven this were heaven enough.— And there ſeemes ſomething to ſpeake for this in the prodigall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18, 19. When firſt he was awaked and convinced of his miſery,
<note place="margin">Luk. 15.18, 19.</note> he ſaith, <hi>He will returne to his father, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170645:166"/>and am not worthy to be called thy ſonne, make me as one of thy</hi> [hired] <hi>ſervants:</hi> Now he would be a <hi>hired</hi> ſervant; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came to his <hi>father,</hi> and ſaw the <hi>mercy</hi> and indulgence of his father, how he <hi>runs</hi> to meet him, and <hi>embraces</hi> him; he talkes no more of a <hi>hired</hi> ſervant; he was now <hi>overcome</hi> with love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he onely <hi>remembers the wickedneſſe he had done, and abhorres himſelfe for it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 15.21.</note> and ſaith, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee;</hi> he names <hi>hired</hi> ſervants no more. So when firſt the ſoule is <hi>awakened</hi> to ſee ſinne, and miſery by ſinne, then he ſayes, Oh make me as one of thy <hi>hired</hi> ſervant: feare of hell, and deſire of heaven, are the two great <hi>plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> which move him: But when once the <hi>ſoule comes</hi> over to Chriſt and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when once it hath <hi>taſted</hi> of his mercy in pardoning, his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him; then doth he <hi>fall</hi> downe and <hi>abhorre</hi> himſelfe, as it is ſaid there of thoſe whom God ſettled the promiſes upon, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. And now all he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires is to <hi>ſerve</hi> God for himſelfe; he <hi>ſees</hi> ſo much <hi>beauty,</hi> hath <hi>taſted</hi> ſo much <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> that if he had the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, it were all too <hi>little</hi> to be laid out for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170645:167"/>him: It is not the <hi>bloud</hi> within his veines, the <hi>ſpirits</hi> within his arteries, the <hi>life</hi> within his body, that can be too <hi>deare</hi> to be laid out for him: now all the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> is, not what will God <hi>give</hi> me, but what ſhall I <hi>give</hi> God? <hi>What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Lord for all his goodneſſe?</hi> he is <hi>willing</hi> to goe through a <hi>ſea</hi> and through a <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> through any <hi>difficulties,</hi> any <hi>duties;</hi> and all he can doe it fals <hi>infinitely</hi> ſhort of his <hi>heart</hi> and good will to God; all his <hi>expreſſions</hi> they are but a little of his <hi>larger</hi> affections in him; and though God ſhould never doe <hi>more</hi> for him, yet his heart doth <hi>burne</hi> with ſuch affections to God, that he counts <hi>all</hi> he can doe for him, but a <hi>little</hi> of that much he could beteeme him.</p>
            <p>And now though I did not need to <hi>proceed</hi> any further in this, yet give me leave, becauſe this is the maine in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> yet to proceed a little further in the clearing of it to you. For anſwer then to this third <hi>branch</hi> of the Query, <hi>Whether a Chriſtian man may not doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with an eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> or with reſpect to heaven and glory. I anſwer <hi>affirmatively,</hi> and in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to that contrary opinion, I ſhall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170645:167"/>lay downe and <hi>evidence</hi> theſe two poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Poſition. <hi>That we may obey God with respect to heaven and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſition. <hi>That we ought to have respect to heaven and glory in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two <hi>poſitions</hi> I ſhall indevour to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> to you, though not upon the ſame <hi>grounds</hi> whereon the lawfulneſſe of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>reward</hi> in our obedience is <hi>uſually</hi> built: I ſhall labour to ſettle it upon ſuch <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and yet <hi>true</hi> grounds, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall ſee the <hi>reaſon</hi> of our diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt <hi>branch</hi> of the Query. We will beginne with the <hi>firſt,</hi> which is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Poſ. <hi>That it is lawfull, and we may obey God with respect to eternall rewards, heaven and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>handling</hi> of this, in regard I <hi>find</hi> that thoſe who have <hi>maintained</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, have grounded that <hi>opinion</hi> upon miſtakes, and <hi>falſe</hi> conceptions of what <hi>heaven</hi> and glory is: I find they have made <hi>falſe draughts</hi> of heaven, and have too much <hi>penſild</hi> it out after a carnall manner; a way farre below heaven and glory. And thereupon I conceive, have
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170645:168"/>grounded this opinion, that we may not eye it in our obedience. I ſhall therefore in the firſt place (having in the <hi>entrance</hi> upon the <hi>Query</hi> cleared what was meant by <hi>respect,</hi> or eying of the reward) ſet downe now what we <hi>conceive</hi> is truely meant by <hi>heaven</hi> and glory.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt <hi>firſt</hi> tell you, that if you do <hi>abſtract</hi> or ſeparate that <hi>from heaven</hi> which a <hi>carnall</hi> heart doth <hi>conceive</hi> to be heaven, that is <hi>heaven</hi> to a godly man. Carnall men doe <hi>fancie</hi> heaven under car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall notions; they looke upon it as <hi>a place</hi> where there is <hi>freedome</hi> from all miſery; and where there is <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of all pleaſures and happineſſe: but both theſe, the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> and the <hi>happineſſe,</hi> the freedome and injoyment; they <hi>fancie</hi> in a way ſutable and <hi>complying</hi> with their carnall or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hearts. This indeed is a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but this is not a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: indeed we read <hi>heaven</hi> ſet out <hi>ſumptuouſly</hi> to us in the Scripture,
<note place="margin">Revel. 21.18, 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.18, 19. <hi>The wals thereof are Iasper, and the Citie is of pure gold, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof are garniſhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious ſtones; the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of Iasper, — and the twelve Gates are twelve Pearles,</hi> — thus God
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170645:168"/>is pleaſed to <hi>penſil</hi> it out, as if he would <hi>tempt</hi> a worldling, and even <hi>corrupt ſenſe</hi> it ſelfe which ſhall never come there, to ſeeke the <hi>inioyment</hi> of it. But theſe you muſt know are <hi>metaphoricall</hi> ſpeeches, becauſe the <hi>glory</hi> of heaven cannot be <hi>penſild</hi> and lim'd out as it is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth <hi>condeſcend</hi> here to our weakeneſſe, and even to <hi>ſenſe</hi> it ſelfe; and <hi>penſils</hi> out heaven and glory by ſuch things as are <hi>knowne</hi> to men to be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Not that we are to <hi>conceive</hi> that heaven is <hi>any</hi> ſuch thing; nay, or that there is any <hi>ſuch thing</hi> in heaven; if you thinke ſo, I ſhall <hi>ſpoyle</hi> your heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done; certainly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God needs not to be <hi>beholding</hi> to ſtones, though <hi>precious</hi> ſtones, to make <hi>heaven</hi> glorious, no more then the <hi>Sunne</hi> needs to be <hi>beholding</hi> to the <hi>Starres</hi> to make the day. God himſelfe <hi>fils</hi> heaven with Glory, and makes it <hi>infinitely</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. God in <hi>heaven</hi> is the <hi>glory</hi> of heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To what purpoſe ſhould there be ſuch poore <hi>beggerly</hi> ſenſitive things, to thoſe who are <hi>all ſpirit</hi> and glory? theſe things are <hi>below</hi> the ſpirit of a godly man here; he hath a more <hi>noble</hi> ſpirit, he can
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170645:169"/>now <hi>trample</hi> upon <hi>gold</hi> and ſilver, <hi>Pearles</hi> and <hi>Diamonds:</hi> and if his <hi>ſpirit</hi> be above theſe things here; what are <hi>theſe</hi> to him in heaven? if theſe be <hi>below</hi> him while he is here <hi>below;</hi> what are they then, when he ſhall get <hi>above?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides, theſe are but <hi>beggerly</hi> glory, to the <hi>meaneſt</hi> glory in heaven; you ſhall turne your <hi>eyes</hi> no whither but <hi>behold</hi> a farre greater <hi>glory</hi> then theſe are; every <hi>glorified</hi> ſoule <hi>ſhall be more glorious then the Sunne in its glory:</hi> alas, what are <hi>precious</hi> ſtones, but <hi>pebble</hi> ſtones, if <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> to the glory of a glorified Saint?</p>
            <p>But to <hi>proceed</hi> no <hi>further,</hi> upon the miſtake. I conceive in <hi>briefe,</hi> that by <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rewards,</hi> is meant what ever ought to be the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of the deſire of a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>ſanctified</hi> ſoule: Not to ſpeake of it in that <hi>largeneſſe</hi> which
<note n="*" place="margin">Burrows, Moſes <hi>choice.</hi> 529.</note> others have excellently done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>fruition</hi> and injoyment of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>inioyment</hi> of Chriſt, that <hi>Pearle</hi> of price.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the <hi>inioyment</hi> of the Spirit, the onely Comforter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is the <hi>perfection</hi> and fulneſſe of grace.</p>
            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:170645:169"/>
            <p n="5">5. It is an <hi>eternall Sabbath;</hi> a reſt, and a <hi>reſt</hi> in <hi>Iehovah,</hi> in whom there is all reſt: it is a <hi>reſt</hi> after all <hi>motions;</hi> all <hi>pantings</hi> after him, are now <hi>reſts</hi> in him, and in him as in your <hi>center,</hi> your proper <hi>place</hi> of reſt; it is a <hi>reſt</hi> with glory, though here they ſeldome, yet in <hi>heaven</hi> they perfectly meet, and that for all eternitie.—</p>
            <p>And tell me now in this <hi>little</hi> I have ſaid of it, whether a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may not deſire all this? whether a Chriſtian may not <hi>eye</hi> this, and have <hi>respect</hi> to this in his ſervice and obedience?</p>
            <p n="1">1. May we not deſire and have <hi>respect</hi> to the <hi>inioyment</hi> of God in our ſervice? <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and in earth I deſire in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thee?</hi> Pſal. 73.25. The injoyment of God was the utmoſt of his deſire in heaven: and it is ſet downe as the top priviledge by Chriſt, to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and may we not eye it here? Certainely the more <hi>respect</hi> we carry to the <hi>inioyment</hi> of God in our obedience, the more <hi>noble</hi> is our obedience; the more <hi>eye</hi> you carry to the <hi>inioyment</hi> of God in a <hi>dutie,</hi> the more <hi>noble</hi> are your ſpirits in duty: and may we now <hi>pray</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:170645:170"/>and doe dutie with <hi>respect</hi> to get a <hi>little</hi> communion with God and Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>respects</hi> your duties are not <hi>ſound:</hi> and may we not <hi>ſerve</hi> God then with <hi>respects</hi> to the full <hi>inioyment</hi> and communion with him? how abſurd is this?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And may we not <hi>deſire</hi> Chriſt, and obey God, and <hi>follow</hi> after him in the <hi>waies</hi> of holineſſe with <hi>respects</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Chriſt?

            <p n="3">3. And thirdly, may we not <hi>deſire</hi> the Spirit, who is the onely <hi>Comforter;</hi> yea, and ſerve God with <hi>reſpects</hi> to the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, who is the <hi>comforting,</hi> who is the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> Spirit, who is now in <hi>us;</hi> but we ſhall hereafter be <hi>in</hi> him: As it was ſaid of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation</hi> of glory, <hi>he was in the Spirit on the Lord day,</hi> Revel. 1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And may we not <hi>obey</hi> God, and ſerve him with <hi>reſpect</hi> to perfection and <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Grace. May we here <hi>ſerve</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That we ought to have respect to heaven, and glory in our obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in theſe two, I have ſufficiently anſwered the third <hi>Branch</hi> of the fifth Query, viz. <hi>Whether a Chriſtian may not doe dutie with reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> I ſhall now haſten the reſt—</p>
            <p>We are now come to a ſixt Query, which is; <hi>Whether this be part of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Chriſt, to be free from obedience unto man;</hi> or whether to <hi>obey men,</hi> be any <hi>infringement</hi> of our <hi>libertie</hi> by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now before I come to the Anſwer of this; I muſt tell you, There are ſome <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that ſeeme to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> that it doth not <hi>ſtand</hi> with Chriſtian <hi>libertie</hi> to be <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to man.

            <p>Now contrary again to this, we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the powers that are, are ordained of God:</hi> and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the king as ſupreame. — As free, and yet not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your libertie for a cloake of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but as the ſervants of God.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>ſubiection</hi> which <hi>may</hi> bee yeelded with the <hi>preſervation</hi> of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie.</p>

            <p n="2">2. We are in bondage to Satan, not that we <hi>owed</hi> him any thing; we were onely <hi>indebted</hi> to Gods Iuſtice; but he is Gods <hi>Iaylor,</hi> who holds poore ſoules downe as under <hi>brazen</hi> barres, and iron gates not to be broken; if a man were in <hi>bondage,</hi> it is ſome reliefe to have a <hi>mercifull</hi> jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; but this addes to the <hi>miſery,</hi> thou haſt a <hi>cruell</hi> jaylor, the jaylor of hell is like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> who will take no <hi>rewards,</hi> he will not be <hi>bribed,</hi> nor <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> to ſet thee free. Satan is a cruell Tyrant <hi>who rules in the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. And you are <hi>taken captive at his will,</hi> as the Apoſtle tels us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. Indeed he hath ſome that are more <hi>royall</hi> ſlaves then others: Some he <hi>keepes</hi> in <hi>arctâ cuſtodiâ,</hi> cloſe priſoners; holds them downe with many <hi>weights</hi> and chaines, under the <hi>raging</hi> power of many <hi>luſts</hi> and corruptions; and ſome he <hi>keepes</hi> in <hi>liberâ cuſtodiâ,</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at large; he ſuffers them to <hi>walke</hi> about; they have the <hi>libertie</hi> of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170645:184"/>but yet are <hi>clapt</hi> up at his pleaſure; they are taken <hi>captive</hi> at his will: though he may ſuffer them to <hi>doe</hi> many actions; <hi>Herod</hi> to heare, <hi>Iudas</hi> to preach, yet he hath <hi>hold</hi> of them by their luſts, he can <hi>bring</hi> them back when he pleaſeth. And that is a ſecond particular, you are in <hi>bondage</hi> to Satan. And this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>cruel</hi> bondage; a mercileſſe bondage: What is the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>compariſon</hi> of this to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? And</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an <hi>univerſall</hi> bondage. 1. <hi>

            <p n="3">3. And it is <hi>univerſall</hi> in reſpect of <hi>actions</hi> and performances; thou canſt not <hi>performe</hi> one <hi>action</hi> as a free man; thou maiſt performe the <hi>actions</hi> of a free man, ſuch actions as free men doe; but thou canſt not <hi>performe</hi> them as a free man: thou <hi>prayeſt</hi> as a ſlave, not a ſonne; thou <hi>weepeſt</hi> as a ſlave, not as a free man: It is more for <hi>feare</hi> of the laſh, then for <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin and love of God: all thy <hi>actions</hi> are
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170645:184"/>actions in bondage; thy very <hi>ſpirit</hi> is in bondage, thou haſt no <hi>ſpirit</hi> of freedome, of <hi>naturalneſſe</hi> and delight in any thing thou doſt.</p>
            <p>And this is a ſad condition: In this condition thou art till Chriſt ſet thee free: but yet further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou art in <hi>bondage</hi> to the Law, and that 1. To the <hi>curſe:</hi> 2. To the <hi>rigor</hi> of the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou art in <hi>bondage</hi> to the curſe of the law; to the <hi>penalties</hi> and forfeitures of the law: the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the workes of the law they are under the curſe.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For it is written, Curſed is every one who doth not continue in all things which are written in the Booke of the law to doe them,</hi> and that is impoſſible: and therefore you muſt needs be <hi>unavoidably</hi> under the curſe.—</p>
            <p>And if we ſhould now take this in <hi>pieces,</hi> &amp; ſhew you how much lies in the <hi>bowels</hi> of this curſe; you would then ſee your <hi>miſerable</hi> condition. It doth <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> all miſeries temporall, ſpirituall, and eternall. It is</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>comprehenſive</hi> curſe, an <hi>univerſall</hi> curſe; you are <hi>curſed</hi> in every condition,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170645:185"/>in your <hi>gold,</hi> ſilver, relations; in your very <hi>mercies;</hi> where others are <hi>bleſſed</hi> in their afflictions, you are curſed in your <hi>mercies.</hi> As there is a <hi>bleſſing</hi> hid in the <hi>worſt</hi> things to the godly; a <hi>bleſſing</hi> in ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in poverty, in croſſes, loſſes, death it ſelfe.— So there is a <hi>curſe</hi> in the <hi>beſt</hi> things to wicked men; a curſe in your gold and ſilver, in your comforts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.—It is an <hi>extenſive</hi> curſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an <hi>unavoydable</hi> curſe; as thou art a ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo thou art borne an <hi>heire</hi> to this curſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is an <hi>unſupportable</hi> curſe, which <hi>men</hi> nor <hi>Angels</hi> are able to beare: you ſee the <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves they lye under it, and cannot <hi>helpe</hi> themſelves: the <hi>wrath</hi> of man may be <hi>borne,</hi> at leaſt undergone. It is but a wrath <hi>reacheth</hi> to the body;
<note place="margin">Parce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; tu carce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, ille Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hennam.</note> but who can <hi>beare</hi> the wrath of God? it is a wrath <hi>reacheth</hi> to the ſoule, and who <hi>knowes,</hi> much leſſe who can <hi>beare</hi> the power of his wrath?</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an <hi>unremoveable</hi> curſe: if we looke upon any thing we can doe; if God <hi>lay</hi> it on, it is not all the <hi>power</hi> and wit of men or Angels that can take it off. As none can take <hi>beleevers</hi> out of the <hi>hands</hi> of Gods mercy; ſo none can take <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:170645:185"/>out of the <hi>hands</hi> of his juſtice. And that is the firſt <hi>particular:</hi> you are in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the curſe of the law.</p>
            <p n="2">2 You are in <hi>bondage</hi> to the <hi>rigor</hi> of the law: which requires in the rigor of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hard things, <hi>difficult</hi> things: look over the <hi>duties</hi> commanded, and ſee if they be not difficult things: Nay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It requires <hi>impoſſible</hi> things in the <hi>ſtation</hi> wherein we are: <hi>It is a yoake we are not able to bear,</hi> Act. 15.10. We might as well be ſet to move <hi>mountaines,</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Sunne</hi> in its courſe, to fetch yonder <hi>Starre</hi> from heaven, as to doe what the law commandeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet all this it <hi>requires</hi> to be done of us in the <hi>exactneſſe,</hi> and according to the <hi>exactneſſe</hi> of the command. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>perfect</hi> obedience, both in reſpect of the <hi>principle,</hi> and in reſpect of the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and in reſpect of the <hi>end:</hi> it will <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> nothing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea and all this it <hi>requires</hi> in our owne <hi>perſons.</hi> It will not <hi>admit</hi> of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> by a ſuretie: not of <hi>performance</hi> by another, that is <hi>Gospel;</hi> it requires all in our <hi>owne perſon,</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nay, and it will not <hi>accept</hi> of the

            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding all this <hi>exaction</hi> from you; yet it will not <hi>afford</hi> you any ſtrength, nor <hi>ſuffer</hi> you to get <hi>helpe</hi> of another; you muſt <hi>beare</hi> your burden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: It layes <hi>load</hi> on you; impoſeth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>conſiders</hi> not your ſtrength; nor will <hi>afford</hi> none to you: it bids you <hi>looke</hi> to it as well as you can; it will have it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>by you,</hi> or <hi>out of you.</hi>

We abuſe Chriſtian <hi>libertie,</hi> when in the uſe of it we <hi>ſcandall</hi> others: libertie was <hi>purchaſed</hi> for the <hi>comfort</hi> of our ſelves, not for the <hi>affliction</hi> of others; they abuſe it indeed, who ſo uſe it, as to others <hi>affliction.</hi> We reade of ſome young <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Corinth would eate meat <hi>offered</hi> to Idols, to that end onely to <hi>ſhew</hi> their libertie: But the Apoſtle tels them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is frequent in <hi>inſtructing</hi> them, how to <hi>exerciſe</hi> Chriſtian libertie in caſe of <hi>ſcandall. Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Brethren you have been called unto libertie, onely uſe not libertie for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another.</hi> Chriſt hath <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> off our former yoake of bondage, not that we ſhould be more <hi>Wanton,</hi> but more <hi>carefull:</hi> Indeed for the <hi>comfort</hi> of our ſelves, but not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> another, as the Apoſtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Through thy knowledge ſhall thy weake brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I will <hi>haſten</hi> to a concluſion, and therefore will <hi>ſhut</hi> up all in a word.</p>
            <pb n="350" facs="tcp:170645:192"/>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>ſecond</hi> way, whereby we doe <hi>abuſe</hi> our Chriſtian <hi>libertie;</hi> and that is when we <hi>uſe</hi> it to <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> many will ſay they have <hi>Chriſtian</hi> libertie; and therefore dare <hi>venture</hi> upon any <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> cuſtomes and geſtures, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>warranted</hi> by the Word; this indeed is <hi>Chriſtian</hi> licenciouſneſſe, not <hi>Chriſtian</hi> libertie; Chriſtian libertie is yet a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed libertie, bounded with Laws and Rules; but theſe are men within no bounds, and therefore Libertines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We doe <hi>abuſe</hi> it when we make <hi>void</hi> the law of God; as I have ſhewed you at large, when we ſhall <hi>iudge</hi> it our <hi>libertie</hi> to be <hi>exempted</hi> from dutie; which indeed is true <hi>bondage,</hi> no Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. The <hi>libertie</hi> of a Chriſtian lies not in <hi>exemption</hi> from ſervice, but in <hi>ſervice;</hi> ſurely that man is yet in <hi>bondage</hi> who doth not judge <hi>ſervice</hi> his libertie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we give too much <hi>ſcope</hi> to our ſelves in <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>lawfull.</hi> It is an <hi>eaſie</hi> thing to <hi>runne</hi> from uſe to abuſe; of ſuch men <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeakes in the 4. verſe of that Epiſtle: <hi>There are certaine men turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When we doe <hi>uſe</hi> it <hi>undutifully;</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:170645:192"/>denying <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>lawfull Authoritie</hi> in things <hi>lawfull</hi> upon pretence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>lihertie;</hi> which is indeed to make the <hi>world</hi> levell; and throw downe all <hi>lawfull</hi> Authoritie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When we will be <hi>tied</hi> to nothing, <hi>bound</hi> to nothing but what our owne ſpirits <hi>incline</hi> us to; of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large: and therefore I ſhall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> all with the <hi>words</hi> of the Apoſtle, in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>You are free, yet uſe not your libertie for a cloake of maliciouſneſſe, but as the ſervants of God.</hi>

But the <hi>faith</hi> of which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in the <hi>covenant</hi> of grace, is <hi>founded</hi> upon the <hi>promiſe</hi> made in Chriſt. Secondly, not withſtanding both are from God, yet the <hi>faith</hi> which exact juſtice in the <hi>covenant</hi> of Nature preſuppoſes, is from God (as the Schooles ſpeake) by way of Nature: whereas the <hi>faith</hi> which is required in the <hi>covenant</hi> of grace, is from God too; but ſo as by way of <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> grace.

               <p>But from hence a greater and more <hi>weighty difficultie</hi> ſeemeth to ariſe: for ſeeing God is <hi>infinite,</hi> it may not abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be demanded, <hi>In what respect could Moſes be a Mediatour betweene God and man, ſeeing he himſelfe was but a man?</hi> To this we anſwer: that <hi>Mediation</hi> is twofold.
