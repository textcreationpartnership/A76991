         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. We will ≈øhew you the <hi>Quality</hi> of this freedome here ≈øpoken of.</p>

            <p>And this briefly, that ≈øo we may come to that which I have chiefly intended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, what freedome that is for <hi>kinde,</hi> of which Chri≈øt doth here ≈øpeake, and into which Chri≈øt doth <hi>in≈øtate</hi> Beleevers. For the clearing of which, it is needfull to tell you that there are <hi>foure</hi> kinds of freedome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>naturall</hi> freedome. 2. <hi>Politicall.</hi> 3. <hi>Sen≈øuall.</hi> 4. <hi>Spirituall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, A <hi>Naturall</hi> freedome, ≈øuch a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as is in every thing by nature, every thing in nature injoyes a naturall freedome: but of this it is not ≈øpoken.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170645:18"/>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Politicall</hi> freedome, which is freedome of ≈øuch a Nation, ≈øuch a State, ≈øuch a Commonwealth, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and of this the Iewes thought Chri≈øt ≈øpake; they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øeed, and therefore free; but of this Chri≈øt did not ≈øpeake.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a <hi>corrupt and ≈øinfull</hi> freedome, which we expre≈ø≈øe under the word <hi>Libertini≈øme:</hi> and the Apo≈øtle ≈øets downe in the 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 13. <hi>Brethren ye are called unto libertie; but u≈øe not libertie as an occa≈øion to the fle≈øh;</hi> that is, as an occa≈øion to ≈øinne; this is fearefull, to turne the <hi>grace</hi> of God into <hi>wantonne≈ø≈øe,</hi> of whom the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh in the fourth of <hi>Iude, There are certaine men creept in unawares, who were of old ordained to the condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of God into la≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who perhaps did rea≈øon with them, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> That they might <hi>abound</hi> in ≈øinne becau≈øe God hath <hi>abounded</hi> in grace; which was fearefull, no rea≈øoning of a child of God. And of the ≈øame men the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>As free, and not u≈øing your libertie as a cloake of maliciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe;</hi> that is, a pretence, or a colour to ≈øin. <hi>But as the ≈øervants of God,</hi> &amp;c. It is evill to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170645:19"/>≈øinne, to <hi>doe any act of</hi> maliciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but much more to <hi>cloake</hi> it, cover it; and much more againe to <hi>make</hi> Chri≈øtian <hi>libertie</hi> the <hi>cloake</hi> of ≈øinne, that is mo≈øt damnable; to make Religion, to make the truth of God, to make Chri≈øtian liberty ≈øo dearely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed, a cloake or pretence to ≈øinne; or to take occa≈øion to ≈øinne by it, is a fearefull ≈øinne.</p>
            <p>But of this Chri≈øt doth not here ≈øpeake, this is our <hi>bondage,</hi> and not our <hi>freedome</hi> as I ≈øhall ≈øhew you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a <hi>≈øpirituall</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly freedome; a freedome <hi>purcha≈øed</hi> by Chri≈øt, <hi>revealed</hi> in the Go≈øpel, <hi>conveyed</hi> to the Saints, as the great <hi>dowry</hi> of Chri≈øt to his Church and Spou≈øe.</p>
            <p>There are two great things Chri≈øt hath intru≈øted into the hands of his Church: Fir≈øt, <hi>Chri≈øtian faith.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Chri≈øtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And as we are to contend earne≈øtly for the <hi>maintenance</hi> of the faith, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith,
<note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> 
               <hi>Iude</hi> 3. So al≈øo for the <hi>maintenance</hi> of Chri≈øtian libertie,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1.</note> again≈øt all oppugners and underminers of it. Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand fa≈øt in the libertie wherewith Chri≈øt made you free.</hi> And much like to this is that of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>You are bonght with a price, be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170645:19"/>no more the ≈øervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23</note> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the generall then I ≈øay, the freedome into which Chri≈øt hath in≈øtated beleevers, is a <hi>≈øpirituall,</hi> a <hi>divine</hi> freedome; a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in oppo≈øition to our <hi>former</hi> bondage. Which clearely under≈øtood, would di≈øcover what our freedome is. We come to the ≈øecond.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is the quality of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>qualitie</hi> in the Text: I ≈øhall but adde two more to it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is a <hi>reall</hi> freedome, not an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, not a fancied freedome; there are too many who are imaginary free, and really in bondage: But this is no imaginarie free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; it is a freedome <hi>indeed,</hi> a true and reall freedome, whom the Sonne makes free are <hi>free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an <hi>univer≈øall</hi> freedome: a freedome which leaves us in no part of bondage: that look what ever was any part of our bondage before; in our liberty now, we are freed from it. But we mu≈øt take heed of taking any part of our <hi>libertie</hi> for our <hi>bondage;</hi> or of our <hi>bondage</hi> for our <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> too many doe: as I ≈øhall ≈øhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170645:20"/>
            <p>We were then in bondage to Satan, to ≈øinne, to the law, to wrath, to death, to hell, &amp;c. And by this priviledge are freed from all, &amp;c. It is an Vniver≈øall freedome. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øall in re≈øpect of per≈øons; all beleevers: and univer≈øall in re≈øpect of parts. We are free from all that was, or is any way part of our bondage: we are free from Satan, from ≈øinne, from the law: as I ≈øhall ≈øhew anon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>con≈øtant</hi> freedome: you are in≈øtated into a condition of freedome; a <hi>≈øtate</hi> of freedome, as you were before in a <hi>≈øtate</hi> of bondage.</p>
            <p>If ever the Lords <hi>Jubile</hi> was proclaimed and pronounced in the ≈øoule, you ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heare of a <hi>returne to bondage</hi> more; you ≈øhall never more returne into bondage to Satan; never come under the bondage to the Law more, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this Chri≈øt implies in the 8. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 35. <hi>The ≈øervant abideth not in the hou≈øe for ever, but the ≈øonne abideth for ever.</hi> The Apo≈øtle expre≈ø≈øeth the ≈øame under an allu≈øion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. where he di≈øtingui≈øheth between tho≈øe who are under the law, and under the Go≈øpel; the children of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> and tho≈øe of the <hi>free;</hi> the heires of the <hi>promi≈øe,</hi> and the ≈øervants of the <hi>law;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:170645:20"/>the one mu≈øt be <hi>ca≈øt out,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and ≈øo Chri≈øt here: <hi>The ≈øervant abides not in the hou≈øe for ever;</hi> they ≈øhall not inherit, <hi>but the Son abideth in the hou≈øe for ever;</hi> they ≈øhall inherit, they ≈øhall enjoy a perpetuall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, never again to return to bondage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We come now to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the parts of this freedome.</p>
            <p>Before I come to tell you what are the parts of our Chri≈øtian freedome, I mu≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily tell you that freedome in generall is divided into the≈øe two branches.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>inchoate</hi> freedome. Secondly, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øummate</hi> freedome, or the freedome we enjoy in the <hi>way,</hi> and the freedome of our Fathers <hi>hou≈øe:</hi> the one in <hi>Grace,</hi> the other in <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ≈øhall ≈øpeake chiefly to the fir≈øt: the freedome of <hi>Saints</hi> here in <hi>Grace,</hi> which is our <hi>inchoate</hi> freedome. And we will briefly lay down the parts of it, which are two

                  <item>1. Privative.</item>
                  <item>2. Po≈øitive.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We will begin with the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They are <hi>free</hi> from Satan: I ≈øay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are freed from Satan. Chri≈øt hath wre≈øt us, and delivered us out of Satans hands. We were pri≈øoners to Satan, even in his chains, but Chri≈øt hath delivered us. This is ≈øet down by way of parable in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170645:21"/>22. <hi>When the ≈øtrong man keeps the hou≈øe, all is in peace: But when a ≈øtronger ≈øhall come, he ≈øhall ≈øpoyle him of his armour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he tru≈øted,</hi> &amp;c. But plainly in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Chri≈øt came into the world, that through death he might de≈øtroy him that had the power of death, the devill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chri≈øt freed us from the wrath of God by purcha≈øe,
<note place="margin">Non pretio dato ≈øed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu potenti.</note> but from the devil by ≈øtrong hand. Indeed he bought us out of the hands of his Fathers ju≈øtice by price; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Satan, as he delivered the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not by price, but by power; not by purcha≈øe, but by ≈øtrong hand. And this is the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Reatus. Regnum. Macula.</note> we are freed from ≈øinne. There are ≈øaid to be three things in ≈øinne. 1. The guilt of ≈øin. 2. The dominion of ≈øin. 3. The defilement of ≈øinne. I ≈øhall onely ≈øpeake unto two of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Chri≈øt hath freed us from the <hi>guilt</hi> of ≈øin: yea of all ≈øin: which appeares in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That none of our ≈øinnes ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none of our ≈øins ≈øhall bring any fruits of wrath upon us.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that none of our ≈øins ≈øhall be able to condemne us; Chri≈øt interpo≈øeth him≈øelfe between us and wrath, that none ≈øhall be able to condemne us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no

            <p>It were no ju≈øtice for God to <hi>require</hi> the payment of Chri≈øt; nay to <hi>receive</hi> the full ≈øatisfaction of Chri≈øt, and to <hi>require</hi> any thing of thee.

Indeed we ≈øhould have ≈øeen Chri≈øt againe if he had not ≈øatisfied Iu≈øtice; if but the guilt of one of tho≈øe <hi>≈øinnes</hi> he bare had <hi>lien</hi> on him un≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170645:22"/>for, it would have held him under <hi>chains</hi> of death, the <hi>power</hi> of the grave, for ever; he could never have <hi>ri≈øen,</hi> much le≈ø≈øe have <hi>a≈øcended,</hi> and gone to the Father, if he had not an≈øwered Iu≈øtice to the full. And therefore the Apo≈øtle makes a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, he ≈øets the death of Chri≈øt again≈øt what ever Sinne, Satan, Iu≈øtice, or Law can ≈øay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that iu≈øtifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri≈øt that dyed, yea rather that is ri≈øen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who al≈øo maketh interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi> He ≈øaies not, Who ≈øhall accu≈øe, but, who condemne? Indeed we may have <hi>accu≈øers</hi> enough, Sin, Satan, Con≈øcience, &amp;c. but none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: the i≈ø≈øues of life and death are not in their hand. And as none of our ≈øinnes ≈øhall <hi>condemne</hi> us, ≈øo none of our ≈øinnes ≈øhall put us into <hi>a ≈øtate</hi> of condemnation more; none of our ≈øinnes ≈øhall ever put us under the cur≈øe, under wrath againe. And that is the ≈øecond.</p>
            <p n="2">2. None of our ≈øins ≈øhall bring any fruits of wrath on us. We are freed from all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeries, calamities, afflictions, puni≈øhments, which yet are the fruits of ≈øin, as they may be conceived to be fruits of <hi>wrath,</hi> or have <hi>wrath</hi> in them.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170645:22"/>
            <p>If you take away the body, the ≈øhadow mu≈øt needs be removed; ≈øinne is ≈øhe body, puni≈øhment the ≈øhadow that doth attend it and follow it: take away ≈øinne, and then the puni≈øhments are al≈øo taken away, all Gods di≈øpen≈øations are in mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For eternall puni≈øhments. All doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, tho≈øe can never lay hold of any of tho≈øe whom Chri≈øt hath freed from ≈øinne, tho≈øe whom he hath ju≈øtified.</p>

            <p>I grant, that God doth afflict tho≈øe who≈øe ≈øin he yet pardons, but there is a great deale of difference, both in the <hi>hand</hi> whence they come, the <hi>per≈øon</hi> that beare them, the <hi>grounds</hi> of inflicting; the <hi>ends</hi> that God <hi>aymes</hi> at in the inflicting them on us. As I ≈øhall ≈øhew afterward.</p>
            <p>God doth not afflict his people for ≈øin.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As <hi>afflictions</hi> are part of the <hi>cur≈øe</hi> for ≈øinne; ≈øo he cannot doe: So we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170645:23"/>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Afflictiones piorum non ≈øunt ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriae, ≈øed ca≈øtigato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae.</note> As they are <hi>payments</hi> for ≈øin, ≈øatisfactions for ≈øinne, as if Gods <hi>iu≈øtice</hi> were not full enough ≈øatisfied for ≈øinne by Chri≈øt, but he had left <hi>≈øomething</hi> for us to beare in way of ≈øatisfaction; So the Papi≈øts ≈øay, (and therefore they penance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh them≈øelves) but ≈øo doe not we.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth not afflict his people for ≈øinne, as afflictions are the meere fruits of ≈øinne; for as they are the meere fruits of ≈øinne, ≈øo they are part of the cur≈øe. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon wicked men are meerely penall part of the cur≈øe: there is nothing medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in them, they are the effects of meere vindictive ju≈øtice, and not of fatherly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. but afflictions on the godly, they are medicinall to cure us of ≈øinne.</p>
            <p>And this is the Fir≈øt. Chri≈øt hath freed us from the guilt of ≈øinne, by which we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand nothing el≈øe but that wrath, that puni≈øhment which is due to ≈øinne. Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Spirituall, Eternall. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Eternall puni≈øhments, we all agree God hath freed us.</p>

            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170645:23"/>
            <p>God hath thoughts of love in all he doth to his people: the <hi>grounds</hi> of his dealings to us is love, though the <hi>occa≈øion</hi> may be ≈øin, the <hi>manner</hi> of his dealings are love, and the <hi>end</hi> of his dealings are love. 1. Our <hi>good</hi> here, to make us partakers of his holine≈ø≈øe; As the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith. 2. Our <hi>glory</hi> hereafter, to make us partakers of his glory.</p>
            <p>But now it is not ≈øo in Gods puni≈øhments of wicked men. Neither is the <hi>ground</hi> love, nor the <hi>manner</hi> love, nor the <hi>end</hi> love, all his <hi>dealings</hi> with them in this kind, they are <hi>parts</hi> of the cur≈øe, and <hi>parts</hi> of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits for ≈øinne. And that is the fir≈øt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branch, he hath freed us from the guilt of ≈øinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chri≈øt hath freed us from the Dominion of ≈øinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14, <hi>Sinne ≈øhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Why? <hi>for ≈øaith he, You are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> Indeed while we were under the law ≈øin had full dominion; it had not onely <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> in us, but <hi>dominion</hi> over us. And that dominion a <hi>voluntary,</hi> a <hi>willing,</hi> a <hi>free ≈øubiection</hi> and re≈øignation of our ≈øelves, to the motions and ≈øervices of ≈øin.

            </p>
            <p>But now being under <hi>grace,</hi> a covenant of grace, <hi>intere≈ø≈øed</hi> in Chri≈øt, and ≈øet free by him; we are freed from the <hi>dominion</hi> and power of ≈øin.</p>
            <p>Though ≈øtill we have the <hi>pre≈øence,</hi> nay the ≈øtirrings and workings of corruptions, which makes us to have many a <hi>≈øad</hi> heart and wet eye. Yet Chri≈øt hath thus farre freed us from Sinne, it ≈øhall not have dominion;

            </p>
            <p>And this is another part of our freedome by Chri≈øt; we are freed from the law: But what this is we ≈øhall ≈øhew at large.</p>

            <p>And this was the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> ca≈øe, he was once one that expected, (as well he might) as much <hi>good</hi> from the law and his <hi>obedience</hi> to it as any man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I was alive, ≈øaith he, without the law once,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the knowledge of the law once:</hi> But ≈øaith he, <hi>when the commandment came, then ≈øinne revived and I dyed, and the commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death,</hi> that is, I found in ≈øtead of <hi>≈øaving</hi> me, it <hi>killed</hi> me.

It is dead to me, and I to it, and I look for all from Chri≈øt, ‚Äî but thus much ≈øhall ≈øuffice to have ≈øpoken of the fir≈øt. We are freed from the Law as a Covenant. Of which we ≈øhall ≈øpeake more largely in the An≈øwer to the Queries: We will come to other branches of our Chri≈øtian freedome from the Law; which will hang upon this, if we looke upon it, as a Covenant of life and death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You are freed from the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Cur≈øes</hi> of the Law. The Law requires <hi>two things</hi> of them who are under it. Either, that you ≈øhould <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>precepts</hi> which was impo≈ø≈øible, in that ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe and rigidne≈ø≈øe the law commanded them. <hi>Gal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10. <hi>Abrogata e≈øt ex quoad maledictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non quoad dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem.</hi> Cheami.</note> 3. or that we ≈øhould <hi>beare the penalties</hi> of the Law which are in≈øupportable. Either you mu≈øt <hi>obey</hi> the commands, or <hi>≈øuffer</hi> the Cur≈øes of the Law; either <hi>doe</hi> Gods will, or <hi>≈øuffer</hi> Gods will, in <hi>forfeitures</hi> of Soule and body: And in that ≈øad <hi>dilemma</hi> tho≈øe are who are under the Law, as a Covenant. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170645:29"/>already, the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore mu≈øt needs be under the Cur≈øes of the Law.</p>
            <p>But now tho≈øe that are beleevers, they are freed from the law, as a covenant of life and death. And therefore are free from the <hi>cur≈øes and maledictions</hi> of the Law, the law hath <hi>nothing to doe</hi> with them, as touching their <hi>eternall</hi> e≈øtate and condition.</p>
            <p>Hence the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chri≈øt,</hi> that is, to them who are not under the law.</p>
            <p>Were you indeed under the law as a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> there were <hi>condemnation,</hi> nothing el≈øe but <hi>condemnation.</hi> Though the law be not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>≈øave</hi> you, yet it is <hi>able</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> you, though not able to <hi>be≈øtow</hi> the <hi>ble≈ø≈øing;</hi> yet it can <hi>poure</hi> the <hi>cur≈øe</hi> upon you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law,</hi> (that is under the law, as a covenant that look for life and ju≈øtification thereby) <hi>they are under the cur≈øe.</hi> And he u≈øeth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, For it is written:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lex nos reos facit juben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, &amp; non adjuvando,</hi> Aug.</note> 
               <hi>Cur≈øed is he that doth not obey in all things, declaring</hi> he mu≈øt needs be under the <hi>cur≈øe;</hi> becau≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible to <hi>obey</hi> in all things, and to <hi>faile</hi> in any, you are left under the cur≈øe.</p>
            <p>So that I ≈øay, were you under the law,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170645:30"/>the law is able to <hi>condemne</hi> you: though it cannot <hi>≈øave</hi> you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
            <p>But now being in Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt hath freed you: from the <hi>cur≈øes</hi> of the law, and that by <hi>bearing</hi> this cur≈øe for you: as the Apo≈øtle,

Satan, he is ready to lay things to their charge; he is called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.10. <hi>the accu≈øer of the Saints night and day;</hi> he is the great <hi>Calumniator,</hi> ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>Bils</hi> of indictment again≈øt the Saints: ≈øometimes he <hi>accu≈øeth God</hi> to man, as you ≈øee he did with our fir≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, where he <hi>charged God</hi> with envy to his creature, as if he had <hi>forbidden</hi> them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170645:34"/>that tree, becau≈øe they ≈øhould not be <hi>wi≈øe</hi> enough: and you ≈øee how ordinary it is with him, either to accu≈øe Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> when he tels them they may ≈øinne, and yet God will be mercifull; or his <hi>iu≈øtice,</hi> that if they ≈øinne, there is no mercy for them.

            <p>And as he <hi>accu≈øeth</hi> God to man; ≈øo man to God. 1. Either by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi> as you ≈øee in <hi>Io≈øhua, Zach.</hi> 3.1, 2,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 3, 4. And thus he is ever laying crimes, and preferring Bills again≈øt the Saints. So that in all his temptations we may ≈øay, as the man to <hi>Ioab,</hi> when he asked why he killed not <hi>Ab≈øolom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Thou thy ≈øelfe heard what the King commanded, that Ab≈øolom ≈øhould not be hurt; and if I had done this thing thou thy ≈øelf would have been the fir≈øt would have accu≈øed me to the King.</hi> So may we an≈øwer Satan; Thou thy ≈øelfe doe≈øt know that God hath <hi>forbidden</hi> this thing: and if I ≈øhould have done it, would not thou have beene the fir≈øt that would have <hi>accu≈øed me to God?</hi> This is Satans way, he is fir≈øt a <hi>tempter</hi> to draw us to ≈øinne, and then an <hi>accu≈øer</hi> to accu≈øe us to God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170645:35"/>for ≈øinning. 2. Or by way of <hi>≈øu≈øpition</hi> and conjecture; as it was with <hi>Iob.</hi> God <hi>commends</hi> him, Satan <hi>condemns</hi> him; as if he knew <hi>Iob</hi> better then God him≈øelfe. Nay,
<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> and though he could not condemne his <hi>actions,</hi> yet he would quarrell with his <hi>affections.</hi> Surely, what ever his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are, yet <hi>Iobs intentions</hi> are not good; which was as much as to tell God that he was deceived in <hi>Iob,</hi> for certainly, what ever thou thinke≈øt of <hi>Iob,</hi> yet <hi>Iob</hi> doth not ≈øerve thee for nought; he is a <hi>mercenary</hi> fellow, one that ≈øerves thee for loaves, belly ble≈ø≈øings: thou ha≈øt heaped out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward favours on him, and ha≈øt made <hi>a hedge about him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10.</note> fenced him in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that nothing can annoy him. So that you ≈øee there are tho≈øe that will lay to the charge of Gods people. Satan will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Satan</hi> cannot condemne; the <hi>i≈ø≈øues</hi> of life and death are not in his hands, nor ≈øhall his accu≈øation <hi>take place</hi> with God again≈øt us.
<note n="*" place="margin">Vocem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, vim non habet dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus.</note> A man condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him≈øelfe though he have a voyce, yet he hath no power; his te≈øtimony is invalid again≈øt another, &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>They laid to his charge the things he never did:</hi> the like in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> But none can condemne us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, but not only Satan and wicked men, but <hi>con≈øcience</hi> it ≈øelfe may lay things to our charge. Con≈øcience may accu≈øe, and then how can we ≈øay, Who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? Con≈øcience, I ≈øay, may accu≈øe: 1.

            <p>In the fir≈øt we are to li≈øten to the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øations</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170645:36"/>of con≈øcience when it doth charge us truely; <hi>Io≈øephs</hi> Brethrens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience accu≈øed them when they were ≈øo evil intreated in <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp; tels them, <hi>They were verily guilty of the wrong done to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Si non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo.</note> So <hi>David,</hi> after he had numbred the people, <hi>his heart ≈ømote him.</hi> Con≈øcience was not a <hi>bridle,</hi> but it was now a <hi>whip;</hi> it was not a <hi>curb,</hi> &amp; therfore now a <hi>≈øcourge:</hi> he did not hearken to the <hi>warnings,</hi> and therefore feels the <hi>la≈øhings</hi> of con≈øcience: &amp; when con≈øcience doth ju≈øtly accu≈øe us; when it comes in with <hi>evidence</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word, we mu≈øt hear; for there <hi>God ≈øpeakes.</hi> If a <hi>Diall</hi> be not ≈øet by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> it is no matter what it ≈øayes; but if it goes by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> we mu≈øt hearken to it: So if Con≈øcience doe not ≈øpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>word,</hi> we need not matter its <hi>accu≈øations:</hi> but if it ≈øpeak according to <hi>evidence</hi> there, it is good to li≈øten to it. 2. Sometimes Con≈øcience brings in <hi>fal≈øe informations;</hi> it will perhaps tell you tho≈øe things to be ≈øinne which are not: and here it is an <hi>erroneous</hi> con≈øcience; we are not to heare it. 3. Sometimes it will bring in <hi>old</hi> ca≈øes, an≈øwered and ≈øatisfied long agoe: then it is a quarrel≈øome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience: Con≈øcience in this ca≈øe is like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170645:36"/>a contentious trouble≈øome fellow at Law, &amp; God wil deal with it as an hone≈øt <hi>Iudge</hi> doth with ≈øuch a contentious quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel≈øome fellow; he ca≈øts all out of <hi>Court,</hi> as matters not worth hearing; or things that have beene determined long agoe. The≈øe accu≈øations ≈øhall not take hold of the ≈øoule. In this <hi>ca≈øe</hi> I may ≈øay, when <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience</hi> condemnes, God is greater then con≈øcience to <hi>acquit</hi> and ab≈øolve the ≈øoule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, but there is a fourth, which is ready to lay to the charge of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that is the <hi>Law:</hi> The Law may accu≈øe, &amp;c. And how then is it ≈øaid, Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods people? and if the Law may accu≈øe, we cannot be ≈øaid to be <hi>free</hi> from the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and accu≈øations of the the Law?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer: If we ≈øpeake of ≈øinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; neither hath <hi>Con≈øcience,</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> nor the <hi>Law</hi> any right to accu≈øe the people of God. God hath ju≈øtified, and who then ≈øhall accu≈øe?</p>
            <p>Indeed while we are <hi>under</hi> the Law, <hi>before faith;</hi> we are both under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øations, judgements, and ≈øentences of the Law. The Law doth not onely accu≈øe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170645:37"/>us, but the ≈øentence and cur≈øe takes hold of us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It <hi>accu≈øeth</hi> us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.45. as Chri≈øt told them that would not beleeve in him, but looked for ju≈øtification by the Law;
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.45.</note> 
               <hi>Doe not thinke that I will accu≈øe you to the Father, there is one that will accu≈øe you; even Mo≈øes in whom you tru≈øt:</hi> that Law which they looked to be ju≈øtified by, ≈øhould accu≈øe them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not onely accu≈øe us, but <hi>≈øentence</hi> us; yea and the ≈øentence and cur≈øe <hi>takes hold</hi> of us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned already.</hi> And in the 36. ver≈ø. <hi>He that beleeveth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that while you are <hi>under</hi> the Law, before faith and <hi>intere≈øt</hi> in Chri≈øt, the law doth not onely <hi>accu≈øe;</hi> but the law doth condemne.</p>
            <p>But now tho≈øe that have an <hi>intere≈øt</hi> in Chri≈øt: 1. The law cannot <hi>accu≈øe</hi> them of ≈øinne <hi>before</hi> grace; becau≈øe they are pardoned; and this accu≈øation is made void. 2. The law cannot <hi>accu≈øe</hi> of ≈øinne <hi>after</hi> grace, ≈øinne after a pardon. They are not under the accu≈øations, arre≈øts, ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ≈øay, the law cannot ≈øo accu≈øe us
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170645:37"/>of ≈øinne, as to <hi>call</hi> us into that <hi>Court,</hi> as the word doth ≈øignifie <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.

And ≈øo neither the Law, Iu≈øtice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, Satan, can accu≈øe us, to call us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Court; the Court of the Law. For we are (when beleevers) freed from it as a Court, as a Covenant, and ≈øo from the judgements, ≈øentences, condemnations, cur≈øes, and accu≈øations of it.

            <p n="2">2. When I ≈øay, we are <hi>freed</hi> from the accu≈øations of the law: I meane <hi>accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of it as <hi>≈øubordinate</hi> to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold accu≈øation.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170645:38"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, An accu≈øation to <hi>conviction</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> for ≈øinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An accu≈øation to <hi>≈øentence</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> for ≈øinne, the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øeth and condemneth al≈øo, all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations of the Law to them who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, they are <hi>≈øubordinate</hi> to Sentence, Iudgement, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ≈øinne: the Law accu≈øeth and al≈øo condemneth all them under it. But all the accu≈øations of the godly for ≈øinne they are in <hi>≈øubordination</hi> to <hi>conviction</hi> for ≈øinne, and <hi>humiliation</hi> for it, and ≈øo ≈øubordinate to life and ≈øalvation, &amp;c. And ≈øo I conceive the Law may <hi>accu≈øe</hi> tho≈øe who are yet the <hi>Freemen</hi> of Chri≈øt. It may di≈øcover to them how farre they come ≈øhort of the glory of God, how farre they have erred and wandered from the paths of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe them for it, but this accu≈øation is to humiliation, not to condemnation. As I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter: either this mu≈øt be ≈øo, or el≈øe you mu≈øt deny the Law from being a Rule.</p>
            <p>But here two <hi>Queries</hi> are propounded.</p>
            <p>Whether the Law may ju≈øtly accu≈øe us,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quere. </seg>1</label> ≈øeeing we are not under it.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170645:38"/>
            <p>In briefe I An≈øwer,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
               </label> we are not under the <hi>cur≈øes,</hi> but we are under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of it; we are not under the Law for <hi>iudgement,</hi> but we are under the Law for <hi>conduct.</hi> So farre as we walke not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, as a Rule, it hath an <hi>accu≈øing power,</hi> though we are taken out of the <hi>condemning power</hi> of it. There is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>power left</hi> in the Law then for our <hi>good,</hi> our humiliation, our edification. And this is onely a power for our good, and our furtherance in grace.</p>
            <p>Whether the Law is <hi>iu≈øt</hi> in its accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us, ≈øeeing we doe not ≈øinne.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quere. </seg>2</label> And that is founded upon the former; if it be true, that we are freed from the Law as a Rule, or as a Direction of life, (which yet ≈øo to be freed were not a part of our freedome but our bondage) then our breaches of the Law are not ≈øinne;

            <p>The≈øe two <hi>Queries</hi> the invalidne≈ø≈øe of them, and danger of them, we ≈øhall ≈øhew afterwards; in the meane I mu≈øt tell
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170645:39"/>you, that the Law in its <hi>directive power</hi> doth remaine to us. And this mu≈øt needs be plaine from <hi>Galathians</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Law was given</hi> 430. <hi>years after the Promi≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the Law was given 430. yeares after the Promi≈øe, then either as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or as a <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as a <hi>Covenant</hi> it could not be given; for then were God contrary to him≈øelfe, fir≈øt in giving a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> then of <hi>Workes.</hi> And therefore he gave it as a <hi>Rule,</hi> to di≈øcover to us after Iu≈øtification by the Promi≈øe, a Rule of walking with God to all manner of plea≈øing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> That can never be ≈øaid to be part of our <hi>Freedome,</hi> which is a part of our <hi>Bondage:</hi> or that can never be ≈øaid to be part of our <hi>Bondage,</hi> which is part of our <hi>Holines.</hi> But conformity to the Law, and ≈øubjection to the Law of God is part of our holines: Therefore it can never be ≈øaid to be part of our <hi>Bondage.</hi> Indeed there is a <hi>Two-fold ≈øubiection,</hi> The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a Son, and of a Slave.

               <note place="margin">Decalogus e≈øt lex ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualis, Evangelium lex Spiritus.</note> but yet they are ea≈øie in re≈øpect of <hi>divine coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> the Law was a ≈øpirituall Law, but the

            <p>Secondly, This was the <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law, that the Law required obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>in our own per≈øons,</hi> it would not allow of any to doe or worke for us, nor any to help us in the doing of it, we are now freed from this rigour, and God will accept of our obedience by another.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>twofold debt</hi> we owed to God,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The debt</hi> of ≈øinne.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The debt</hi> of ≈øervice.</item>

            <p>The≈øe two, The debt of ≈øinne and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were both <hi>tran≈øacted</hi> upon Chri≈øt, and he hath fulfilled all righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, <hi>legis &amp; crucis,</hi> for us,

            <p>Thirdly, This was the <hi>rigor</hi> of the Law, that it required <hi>univer≈øall, actuall,</hi> as well as per≈øonall obedience, yea and with that rigor, that if you failed in one <hi>tittle,</hi> you were gone for ever, 3 <hi>Gal.</hi> 10. <hi>Cur≈øed is he who obeyes not every thing written in the booke of the Law to dee it.</hi>

Though the Go≈øpell doe <hi>admit</hi> of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet the Law will not owne it. It looks for <hi>exact</hi> obedience to every tittle: From this rigid obedience hath God freed you. And God is plea≈øed for <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øall actuall,</hi> to accept of <hi>univer≈øall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> obedience. <hi>P≈øal</hi> 119.6. <hi>Even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to all his Commandements.</hi> Though there be failing in <hi>action,</hi> yet where there is truth of <hi>affection,</hi> God can owne it.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170645:41"/>In the Go≈øpell God accepteth of <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for <hi>actions,</hi> of <hi>endeavours</hi> for <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> of <hi>de≈øire</hi> for <hi>ability.</hi> Here is all, a Chri≈øtian he is made up of <hi>de≈øires,</hi> of <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> thir≈øtings and bewaylings. <hi>Oh that my wayes</hi> were directed; and <hi>oh mi≈øerable man that</hi> I am! here is Go≈øpell perfection. <hi>Adams</hi> want was rather <hi>will</hi> then power, ours rather <hi>power</hi> then will; there is <hi>will</hi> to doe, but wants <hi>power</hi> to doe: Not that the <hi>will</hi> is perfect; for as we cannot <hi>doe</hi> the things we <hi>would</hi> doe, there is <hi>fle≈øh</hi> in our members: ≈øo we cannot <hi>will</hi> the things we <hi>≈øhould</hi> will; there is <hi>fle≈øh</hi> in our wils: but yet I ≈øay, the fayling of Gods people is more for <hi>want</hi> of power then <hi>want</hi> of will; there is <hi>will</hi> to doe, but there wants <hi>power</hi> to doe, as the Apo≈øtle, <hi>To will is pre≈øent with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>but how to performe that which is good I find not.</hi> And God hath mercy for <hi>can nots,</hi> but none for <hi>will nots:</hi> God can di≈øtingui≈øh between <hi>weakne≈ø≈øe</hi> and <hi>wickedne≈ø≈øe</hi> While thou art under the Law, this <hi>weakne≈ø≈øe</hi> is thy wickedne≈ø≈øe, a <hi>≈øinfull weakne≈ø≈øe,</hi> and therefore God hates it. Vnder the Go≈øpell he looks not upon the <hi>weakne≈ø≈øe</hi> of ≈øaints as their wickedne≈ø≈øe, and therefore he pitties them. Sinne makes tho≈øe who are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170645:42"/>under the Law the <hi>obiects</hi> of Gods <hi>hatred:</hi> Sin in a <hi>Beleever</hi> makes him the <hi>obiect</hi> of Gods pitty. Men you know <hi>hate poy≈øon</hi> in a toade, but <hi>pitty</hi> it in a man. In the one it is their <hi>nature,</hi> in the other their <hi>di≈øea≈øe:</hi> Sin in a wicked man is as poy≈øon in a toad; God hates it and him, it's his nature; but ≈øin in a childe is like poy≈øon in a man; God pitties him, he pitties the Saints for ≈øinnes and infirmities, he hates the wicked. It's the ones nature, and the others di≈øea≈øe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This was againe the <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law, that it <hi>inforced</hi> it ≈øelfe upon the <hi>con≈øcience</hi> with <hi>threats</hi> and with <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> but now the Go≈øpell comes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, with be≈øeeches and love. <hi>I be≈øeech you brethren by the mercies of God, Rom.</hi> 12.1.

Indeed none ≈øhall die till Gods <hi>time,</hi> the wicked≈øt man in the world ≈øhall not die till Gods time.

            <p>Men cut downe <hi>weeds</hi> at any time, but their <hi>corne</hi> they will not <hi>cut downe</hi> till the be≈øt time, <hi>you are Gods husbandry</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, you are his wheat, and when you are <hi>ripe,</hi> when you have done your worke, then, and not till then ≈øhall you be <hi>gathered</hi> into your Ma≈øters Garner.

            <p>Sixtly, wee ≈øhall be freed from the <hi>Grave,</hi> and this comes under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øummate freedome. We will but touch

            <p>And ≈øo much might <hi>≈øatisfie</hi> for the clearing of the fir≈øt Argument: Nay the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>po≈øition</hi> it ≈øelfe, if our

               <hi>adver≈øaries</hi> would be ≈øatisfied. We will heare what they can ≈øay therefore, and an≈øwer it; and then proceed to the re≈øt of the Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Some ≈øay, Though it be a rule, yet it is a rule at our libertie whether we will obey it or no: It is not a binding rule.</p>
            <p>And there are three ≈øeverall Opinions of this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ≈øay, That it bindes us no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then as we are <hi>creatures,</hi> not as we are <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> but as we are <hi>creatures:</hi> But why then are not they bound? I hope they are creatures as well as Chri≈øtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others ≈øay, It doth binde the <hi>fle≈øh,</hi> but not the <hi>≈øpirit;</hi> it doth bind the <hi>nure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> part, but not the <hi>regenerate</hi> to obedience, for that is free: and here is a dangerous Gap opened to all licentiou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe: witne≈ø≈øe the Opinions of <hi>David George,</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Others ≈øay, That it is not a <hi>binding</hi> rule at all; beleevers are no more under the Law, then <hi>England</hi> under the Laws of <hi>Spaine:</hi> nor no more bound to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Law, then any man is bound to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Lawes of

            <p>Now if this be true, it ≈øtrikes downe all: if it be a <hi>rule,</hi> but not a <hi>binding</hi> rule; a rule binding to obedience, it will be of ≈ømall u≈øe.

               <hi>madde</hi> Bea≈øts, Wolves, or Lions, &amp;c. we bind them up in chaines, that they may not doe that mi≈øchiefe, which their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> carry them to: ≈øo the law <hi>chaines</hi> up the wickedne≈ø≈øe of the hearts of men, that they dare not <hi>fulfill</hi> tho≈øe lu≈øtfull inclinations which are in their hearts to doe.</p>

Naturally, <hi>≈øinne</hi> is pa≈øt both <hi>≈øen≈øe</hi> and ≈øhame too: there would be no whoe, no ≈øtay, no banke or bounds to ≈øinne; every man would be as a <hi>devil</hi> to another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have <hi>cau≈øe</hi> to ble≈ø≈øe God, that he hath given a law to <hi>re≈øtraine</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that if men will not be ≈øo good as they ≈øhould be, yet they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained, and not be ≈øo <hi>bad</hi> as they would be. Were it not for this, and that <hi>awe</hi> that God hath ca≈øt upon the ≈øpirits of wicked

            <p>And therefore hath God given a law to ≈øet <hi>bounds</hi> and banks to defend us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the <hi>incur≈øions,</hi> and breaches that ≈øinne would make upon us. He that ≈øets <hi>bounds</hi> and bankes to the <hi>raging Sea,</hi> which otherwi≈øe would <hi>overflow</hi> the Land, doth ≈øet al≈øo bounds and bankes to mens ≈øins, and ≈øinfull affections.</p>
            <p>It is no le≈ø≈øe wonder that the <hi>deluge</hi> of lu≈øt and corruption in men, doth not break forth to the <hi>overflowing</hi> of all banks, then that the <hi>Sea</hi> doth not breake forth upon us, but he that ≈øets <hi>bounds</hi> to the one, doth al≈øo <hi>bound</hi> and re≈øtraine the other.

The ca≈øe is the ≈øame between God and us, We are deeply <hi>indebted</hi> unto God; And to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and us in him, God made a <hi>promi≈øe</hi> of mercy, but men were <hi>≈øecure</hi> and carele≈ø≈øe, and though they were guiltie of ≈øinne, and ≈øo lyable to death, yet being without a Law to <hi>evidence</hi> ≈øinne and death to their con≈øciences, they could not ≈øee it ≈øuch a mercy as it was to have a pardon.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Obiect.</hi> We read that the Law was ≈øet up as a Covenant, and in that u≈øe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it could not <hi>≈øtand</hi> with Grace, and therefore there were <hi>≈øome ends</hi> and u≈øes wherefore the law was given that are not <hi>con≈øi≈øtent</hi> with Grace.</p>

But this ≈øhall be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: I will put my laws into their hearts.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. <hi>For if the fir≈øt Covenant

            <p>Now then for the <hi>clearing</hi> of the≈øe places, there hath beene laid downe by Divines divers <hi>di≈øtinctions</hi> of Covenants. Some have ≈øet downe the≈øe three.</p>

            <p>And this <hi>≈øub≈øervient</hi> Covenant, or old Covenant, is that which God did <hi>≈øtrike</hi> with the people of I≈ørael in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> to <hi>prepare</hi> them to faith, and to <hi>inflame</hi> them with the de≈øire of the <hi>Promi≈øe,</hi> and the coming of Chri≈øt, and to be as it were a <hi>bridle</hi> of re≈øtraint, to <hi>cohibit</hi> them from ≈øinne, till that time that he ≈øhould ≈øend the Spirit of Adoption into their hearts, and <hi>governe</hi> them with a more free ≈øpirit.</p>

            <p n="3">3. They differ in the Antiquitie. The Promi≈øe was more ancient then the Law. It is ≈øaid <hi>the Law was added to the Promi≈øe,</hi> and that 430. yeers after the Promi≈øe was given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ≈øub≈øervient Covenant doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain,</hi> but with <hi>Coaction</hi> and ≈øervility; but the Covenant of Grace by a <hi>willing</hi> and Child-like <hi>inclination</hi> of ≈øpirit, by more freene≈ø≈øe and naturalne≈ø≈øe of ≈øoule.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the ≈øub≈øervient Covenant the <hi>≈øpirit</hi> of <hi>bondage</hi> is given; but in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The old Covenant did <hi>terrifie</hi> the con≈øcience; this doth <hi>comfort</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The object of the old was <hi>man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øleep,</hi> or rather <hi>dead</hi> in ≈øin; of the other is man <hi>awakened,</hi> and <hi>humbled</hi> for ≈øin.</p>

Not a Covenant of <hi>workes,</hi> that I have ≈øhewed at large; becau≈øe there was a <hi>former</hi> Covenant, a Covenant of Grace made, and this was but <hi>added</hi> to it, and not in way of <hi>oppo≈øition,</hi> but ≈øub≈øerviency: be≈øides, this <hi>broken</hi> was capable of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which a Covenant of workes is not capable of: be≈øides, when they had <hi>broken</hi> this, they were not to be <hi>ca≈øt</hi> by it, but had <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>appeale</hi> from the Law to the Go≈øpel, from Gods <hi>Iu≈øtice</hi> offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> pardoning and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you ≈øee they frequently did, when they implored mercy and pardon, for his names ≈øake; <hi>For thy name ≈øake for give, and for thy name ≈øake cover:</hi> under which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions Chri≈øt was <hi>darkely</hi> ≈øhadowed out.</p>
            <p>Againe, if it were a <hi>concluding</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life and death, then could they have had no mercy, no pardon, they mu≈øt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170645:88"/>needs have peri≈øhed; but again≈øt that the apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks act. 15.11. <hi>We beleeve through the grace of Chri≈øt to be ≈øaved even as they:</hi> Nay, and then it had been utterly <hi>incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtent</hi> with the Covenant of Grace.

But I have ≈øhewed you there were no ≈øuch ends, ‚Äî And therefore it mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it was ≈øuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> under which they <hi>≈øtood,</hi> as notwith≈øtanding that they did <hi>≈øtand</hi> under a covenant of Grace, and therfore it could not be a <hi>Covenant</hi> of works. This ≈øeems to be the rea≈øon of the opinion again≈øt the fir≈øt, that though it be called a Covenant, yet it could not be a Covenant of works: And if ≈øo, then mu≈øt it be either a Covenant of Grace, or ≈øome <hi>third</hi> Covenant. Now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be ≈øaid it could not be a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace; Becau≈øe that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe generally reckon up this as one part of our freedome that wee have by Chri≈øt, to be freed from the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and if the Law were a Covenant of Grace onely more <hi>Laegally di≈øpen≈øed,</hi> and under more <hi>Legall admini≈øtrations;</hi> it

And therefore they ≈øaying we are freed from it as a Covenant, cannot po≈ø≈øibly hold it to be a Covenant of Grace. I onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound you the rea≈øon this opinion holds out.</p>
            <p>And if it be neither a Covenant of works, nor a Covenant of Grace, then mu≈øt it of nece≈ø≈øitie be a third Covenant. And yet this ≈øuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> as doth not ≈øtand in <hi>oppo≈øition</hi> to Grace, neither is incon≈øi≈øtent with the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; for then God ≈øhould have <hi>contradicted</hi> him≈øelfe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne his owne purpo≈øe, repented of his owne promi≈øe which he had given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore it is called a <hi>≈øub≈øervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Covenant, which though it ≈øtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>oppo≈øite tearms,</hi> yet it hath it is <hi>≈øub≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient ends</hi> to the Covenant of Grace; and was given by way of <hi>≈øub≈øerviency</hi> to the Go≈øpel, and the more full <hi>revealing</hi> of the covenant of grace, &amp; was <hi>temporary,</hi> &amp; had <hi>re≈øpect</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi> &amp; Gods ble≈ø≈øing there, in obedience to it, and not to heaven, for that was <hi>promi≈øed</hi> by another Covenant which God made with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> before he entred this.

            </p>
            <p>I will give you for brevity, the full <hi>draught</hi> of their thoughts, who <hi>maintaine</hi> this ≈øecond opinion in the≈øe five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was never any more then two <hi>Covenants</hi> made with mankinde, which held out life and ≈øalvation: The fir≈øt was the <hi>Covenant of Workes,</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; the other is the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> after the fall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was never but one way of ≈øalvation ≈øince the fall, and that was by a Covenant of grace: God never ≈øet up another covenant of workes ≈øince the fall, hee puts us now to <hi>beleeve</hi> without <hi>working</hi> for life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That yet all <hi>Adams</hi> po≈øterity they lie under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of workes, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> left them after his fall, till they come over to Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the <hi>law</hi> was <hi>never given</hi> as a Covenant of works, but <hi>added</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, by way of <hi>≈øub≈øerviencie</hi> to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That though the law was given
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170645:90"/>with <hi>mercifull</hi> purpo≈øes, and <hi>≈øub≈øervient</hi> to the covenant of grace; yet it ≈øeemes to come <hi>handed</hi> to us, as though it were the <hi>repetition</hi> of another covenant of workes under which we ≈øtand.</p>
            <p>Or rather the <hi>covenant</hi> of grace under the Old Te≈øtament ≈øeems to be ≈øo <hi>legally</hi> repre≈øented as if it were a covenant of works ≈øtill to us. And it is worth our ob≈øervation to ≈øee how the <hi>covenant</hi> of Grace like the <hi>Sun</hi> in the firmament, hath <hi>ri≈øen</hi> up ≈øtill to further and further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> it was very <hi>darke</hi> and ob≈øcure; from <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to the time of the Prophets the <hi>light</hi> began to appeare. After the Prophets when <hi>Iohn</hi> began his Mini≈øtery, then the <hi>light</hi> was more clearely revealed, under the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery</hi> of Chri≈øt,
<note place="margin">Chameron.</note> who revealed the <hi>bo≈øome</hi> coun≈øels of his Father, there were more <hi>cleare</hi> and glorious <hi>manife≈øtations</hi> of it. After Chri≈øts <hi>re≈øurrection</hi> and the ≈øend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, the <hi>booke</hi> before <hi>cla≈øped,</hi> was now fully <hi>opened, that he that runs might read.</hi> In ≈øo much that ≈øome have called the covenant of Grace before Chri≈øt, <hi>foedus promi≈øsi,</hi> the covenant of promi≈øe; and now under the Go≈øpel the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170645:91"/>covenant of grace, in re≈øpect of the full, cleare, and ample di≈øcovery of it: the <hi>≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi> which before <hi>ob≈øcured</hi> it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; and the whole <hi>platforme of Gods de≈øigne</hi> of ≈øaving man by meer grace ≈øo clearely di≈øcovered, that he that runnes may read it.</p>
            <p>That which ≈øtood upon <hi>oppo≈øite</hi> tearms to the covenant of grace,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>3</label> cannot be ≈øaid to be a covenant of grace, nor yet <hi>≈øub≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> to the covenant of grace; but mu≈øt needs be a covenant of workes.</p>

            <p>Therefore le≈øt this might put it off, ≈øee more plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the law, but the doers of the law ≈øhall be iu≈øtified.</hi> And that the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes here of the <hi>morall</hi> law he ≈øhews after, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 21, 22. where he di≈øcour≈øeth of ≈øome branches of the Morall law: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>For Mo≈øes de≈øcribeth the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe which is of the law</hi> (yet he doth not ≈øay which is by the law) <hi>that the man which doth the≈øe things ≈øhall live by them, but the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe which is of faith ≈øpeakes thus: Who≈øoever beleeves on him, ≈øhall not be a≈øhamed,</hi> ver≈ø. 11. So that the law you ≈øee by the≈øe places ≈øeems to ≈øtand upon <hi>oppo≈øite</hi> termes to grace. And this is the Objection which you ≈øee I have <hi>rai≈øed</hi> to the height: and if this be cleared, then all is done, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now again≈øt the≈øe I might <hi>oppo≈øe</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Scriptures, which ≈øeeme to ≈øpeake again≈øt it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>But that no man is iu≈øtified by the law it is evident, for the iu≈øt ≈øhall live by faith.</hi> Againe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had beene a law given that could have given life, verily righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe

            <p>Be≈øides, God could not <hi>expect</hi> that we ≈øhould <hi>doe,</hi> that we might have life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we were to have <hi>life</hi> before we

            </p>
            <p>Againe, God never <hi>purpo≈øed</hi> life upon obedience, becau≈øe he had <hi>decreed</hi> another way to conferre life upon men; this you ≈øee plaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. where the Apo≈øtle debates the ≈øame thing, <hi>But that no man is iu≈øtified by the law it is evident;</hi> Why, how is that evident? <hi>becau≈øe,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>the iu≈øt ≈øhall live by faith:</hi> as if he had ≈øaid, God hath decreed another way to life; and therefore ≈øurely the former is not the way.</p>
            <p>But yet you will ≈øay, It ≈øeemes as if the <hi>law</hi> did <hi>require</hi> us to do, and <hi>promi≈øe</hi> life to doing: and if ≈øo, certainly the law ≈øtands upon <hi>oppo≈øite</hi> tearmes to grace; and therefore can neither be a covenant of grace, nor ≈øub≈øervient to it.

            <p>Vnto all this give me leave to add thus much in this <hi>unhappy</hi> difference, and we will <hi>conclude</hi> this An≈øwer. I will but give you a few thoughts to con≈øider of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinne doth <hi>naturally</hi> bring <hi>evill</hi> on us: as there is <hi>peace</hi> and good in the <hi>waies</hi> of holine≈ø≈øe, ≈øo there is <hi>evil</hi> and trouble in the <hi>waies</hi> of ≈øinne; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>≈øeparated:</hi> trouble is the <hi>naturall</hi> and proper <hi>fruit</hi> of ≈øinne, that which it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beares. Nay it is in the very bowels of it: Sinne is <hi>malum Catholicum:</hi> It is a <hi>bigge bellied</hi> evill; all evils are the <hi>births</hi> of ≈øinne: if you could <hi>rippe</hi> up ≈øinne, you ≈øhould find all evil in the <hi>bowels</hi> of it: there may be evil of <hi>puni≈øhment</hi> where there is no evill of ≈øinne in it; but all evil of <hi>puni≈øhment</hi> lies in the <hi>evil</hi> of ≈øinne: all the Commandements were given for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170645:110"/>good, and your good lies in obedience to them. And he that <hi>breakes</hi> Gods bounds, doth nece≈ø≈øarily runne upon evill and trouble: Sinne is the <hi>birth</hi> of our hearts, and trouble is the <hi>birth</hi> of ≈øinne; and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is as true a <hi>child</hi> of ≈øinne, as ≈øinne is the naturall <hi>i≈ø≈øue</hi> of our ≈øouls. This is the fir≈øt: ≈øinne doth not only by con≈øequence and Gods ordination, but naturally, bring evil and trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the evil that ≈øin brings, or the trouble that comes by ≈øin; either it is by <hi>chance,</hi> or by <hi>providence,</hi> and by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine di≈øpen≈øation: But not by <hi>chance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> tels us ≈øo; and ≈øure he tels us truth; <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they doe not ari≈øe out of the du≈øt:</hi> And Chri≈øt ≈øaith,

               <hi>There cannot a haire fall from our head, without a providence:</hi> And if not a haire, if not the ≈ømalle≈øt thing without a providence, then much <hi>le≈ø≈øe</hi> the greater. So then the evil that comes by ≈øinne, is not by chance, but by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Divine di≈øpen≈øation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If from <hi>providence,</hi> then either from Gods <hi>active,</hi> or from his <hi>pa≈ø≈øive</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: or if you will, take it thus; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his <hi>permi≈ø≈øive</hi> providence, or by his <hi>active</hi> ordaining <hi>providence.</hi> To ≈øay by his <hi>permi≈øsive</hi> providence onely, this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170645:111"/>cannot ≈øo well ≈øuit with God who is all <hi>act,</hi> nor with the words of the Prophet, <hi>Is there any evill in the Citie which I have not done?</hi> You know it is meant onely of the <hi>evils</hi> of puni≈øhment; not of the <hi>evill</hi> of ≈øinne, there God hath no hand.</p>
            <p>There are many things which God <hi>permits</hi> in the world, which he doth not doe; tho≈øe are the evils of ≈øinne. But the evils of puni≈øhment the≈øe he permits and doth too. <hi>Is there any evill in the Citie which I have not done?</hi> And in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 42.24, 25. where the Prophet makes the ≈øame que≈øtion; and gives the ≈øame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer. <hi>Who gave Iacob for a ≈øpoyle, and I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to the robbers? Did not the Lord, He again≈øt whom we have ≈øinned?</hi>‚ÄîSo that you ≈øee all the≈øe come from divine di≈øpen≈øation. God brings this evill, and he tels us for ≈øinne too.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If God doe in <hi>providence</hi> bring any evill upon his people, then either out of <hi>love,</hi> or out of <hi>anger,</hi> or out of <hi>hatred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Not out of <hi>batred;</hi> ≈øo we grant that cannot be: there is <hi>nothing</hi> that God doth to his people, that is any <hi>fruit</hi> or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of hatred. Indeed <hi>afflictions</hi> on the wicked are fruits of hatred; ≈øome <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings</hi> before the great ≈øhowre of <hi>wrath</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170645:111"/>fall upon them; but it is not ≈øo with his owne people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then ≈øecondly, either out of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>anger.</hi> Certainly not out of anger meerly without love; for the <hi>principle,</hi> the <hi>ground,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of all his dealings with his people is <hi>love;</hi> there is nothing he doth to them <hi>≈øeparated</hi> from love, there is love in all; Nay, and I ≈øay, from love they proceed: for <hi>all his waies are waies of mercy to them that feare him,</hi> P≈øal. 25.10. But becau≈øe <hi>afflictions,</hi> and cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>evils,</hi> and doe ≈øeeme to be the <hi>effects</hi> of one angrie and di≈øplea≈øed; therefore I ≈øay, though they come from love, yet from <hi>love di≈øplea≈øed,</hi> from love offended. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27.
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.27.</note> 
               <hi>God had mercy on him in re≈øtoring Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to health.</hi> Why? had it not beene a mercy to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died too? Are not all his wayes, wayes of mercy? and therefore though he had died, had it not beene a mercy too? What ≈øhall we ≈øay to this? ≈øhall we ≈øay it had been a <hi>mercy</hi> in the i≈ø≈øue, and event, as God would <hi>≈øanctifie</hi> it to him, and doe him good by it, as he him≈øelfe ≈øaith, <hi>All things ≈øhall worke together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. Indeed this is good,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170645:112"/>but this is not all; ≈øinne it ≈øelfe may be a <hi>mercy</hi> in the i≈ø≈øue. But the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>all his wayes, are wayes of mercy,</hi> not a <hi>≈øtep</hi> God takes towards his people, not an <hi>action</hi> that God doth, not one <hi>di≈øpen≈øation</hi> of providence, but it is out of mercy. And therefore what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God had mercy on me in re≈øtoring of him? what needs he to ≈øay ≈øo? ≈øeeing it had beene a mercy if he had beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away? and God had ≈øhewed mercy to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died? why then doth he ≈øay, God had mercy upon me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoring of him? Indeed it had been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to <hi>Paul</hi> if he had died, but a <hi>correcting</hi> mercy, mercy in cha≈øti≈øement; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle ≈øeemes by this phra≈øe to imply a <hi>medium,</hi> or at lea≈øt a difference between <hi>mercy re≈øtoring,</hi> and <hi>mercy depriving</hi> of him. It had beene mercy, but a <hi>correcting</hi> mercy, had God taken him away. ‚Äî So I ≈øay here, though afflictions and cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are out of love; yet becau≈øe they are in them≈øelves evill, therefore I ≈øay, they proceed often (not alwaies) from <hi>love di≈øplea≈øed,</hi> from love offended.</p>
            <p>We ≈øay indeed, that God is angry, not that we are to conceive there is <hi>anger</hi> in God, he hath no <hi>pa≈øsions</hi> or affections in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170645:112"/>him; but we ≈øay he is angry,
<note place="margin">Ira non e≈øt affectus, ≈øed effectus in Deo.</note> becau≈øe he <hi>deales</hi> with us, as men u≈øe to deale with ≈øuch with whom they are angry; they <hi>withdraw</hi> from them, they <hi>chide</hi> them, they <hi>rebuke</hi> them, <hi>correct</hi> them; and ≈øo doth God, in a paternall di≈øplea≈øure, with them he dearely loves.</p>
            <p>But we will come to ≈øhut up this Query in a few particulars which we will lay downe for your full ≈øatisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>God doth not <hi>ever cha≈øti≈øe</hi> his people for ≈øinne. I ≈øay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Po≈øi. </seg>1</label> all the cha≈øti≈øements which God inflicts upon his people they are not for ≈øinne: there are ≈øome which he inflicteth for the <hi>prevention</hi> of ≈øinne; as <hi>Pauls</hi> temptation was.

That is a fearfull ≈øinne, to ca≈øt <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> and coole any <hi>motions</hi> of the Spirit of God. When God moves, hee comes with power too, for the performance of the dutie, then we goe full ≈øaile, and it is good to take tho≈øe hints. But good hearts do often here mi≈øtake to their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing, and think if they do not goe with every motion how un≈øea≈øonable ≈øoever
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170645:115"/>they have quenched, and rejected a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit.

And there are foure times when Satan doth u≈øually put men on duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When our <hi>≈øpirits</hi> are much <hi>≈øunk</hi> and downe, either <hi>oppre≈ø≈øed</hi> with temptations or troubles, then he may put you on to doe dutie: not but that I ≈øay God doth at the≈øe times put us upon dutie; but yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Satan too. He deales with us, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> with the I≈øraelites, when they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> oppre≈ø≈øed with their captivitie, then they ≈øay, <hi>Come now ≈øing us one of the ≈øongs of Sion;</hi> ≈øo when the ≈øpirit is <hi>oppre≈ø≈øed</hi> and overwhelmed, when he thinkes we are upon ≈øome great <hi>di≈øad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> and wee ≈øhall but <hi>torture</hi> our ≈øelves, and <hi>di≈øcourage</hi> our ≈øelves more, then it may be hee puts us to pray, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, like them who dealt with Chri≈øt, blinded his eyes,
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.65.</note> and then <hi>bid him prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie who ≈øtrikes him;</hi> ≈øo when he hath <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> our eyes, he bids us now ≈øee, now <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,</hi> now pray, when he hath <hi>di≈øturbed</hi> our ≈øpirits, when he hath <hi>troubled</hi> the ≈øea,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170645:116"/>that it ca≈øts up nothing but <hi>mire</hi> and dirt, di≈øtru≈øtfull and unbeleeving thoughts, then he bids us goe and pray: which yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times helps to <hi>lay</hi> the ≈øtorm, and quiet the <hi>≈øpirit</hi> too, and Satan lo≈øeth by it; it proves his owne di≈øadvanage, <hi>unexpected</hi> Grace comes in which he was not aware of, nor could fore≈øee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ≈øecond time when Satan may put us on duty is, When wee are called by God upon <hi>other imployments,</hi> either <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> or <hi>≈øpirituall.</hi> 1. <hi>Spirituall,</hi> either to heare, to confer, or to do other duties, then he bids thee go pray, he loves to make du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>interfere,</hi> 2. or when we are called upon <hi>naturall</hi> imployments, it may be to eat, drink, to ≈øleep, and ≈øomtimes he hath carried a poor ≈øoule out of his bed, or from his meat, and he mu≈øt now go pray, which perhaps hath not beene for Satans advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage neither. Thus he ≈øometimes deales with <hi>poore</hi> ≈øoules in temptation, and if they do not do it upon his <hi>in≈øtigation,</hi> then he tells them they have <hi>re≈øi≈øted</hi> a motion of the Spirit. If they do, why it is for their <hi>trouble</hi> too; perhaps he will charge them after all with Popery and ≈øuper≈øtition, and voluntary penance, that they mu≈øt ri≈øe in the night to go to prayer, &amp;c. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170645:116"/>this at your hand? It were good in ≈øuch ca≈øes to ≈øay with a Godly man, who was thus <hi>moved</hi> to prayer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he was to go to ≈øleep, <q rend="inline">Get thee hence Satan, I will goe to dutie when God calls, not when thou ≈øugge≈øts, I have <hi>committed</hi> my ≈øoul into the arms of Chri≈øt, and in his arms I re≈øt and ≈øleep. ‚Äî</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third time when Satan may put us on duty. When we are <hi>weake</hi> in body, and not able to perform it, when we want <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> ≈øpirits to doe the work, then will he put on to it, he knows that if we do it, then he ≈øhall by rea≈øon of our <hi>naturall</hi> weaknes get advantage of us. When he puts us to lift <hi>loggs,</hi> he knows we are weak. When he <hi>moves</hi> to dutie, he <hi>knowes</hi> we have no ≈øtrength.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth time when hee puts us upon duty is, When he <hi>thinks</hi> he puts us upon a <hi>≈ønare,</hi> when he thinkes dutie will be a ≈ønare to us, hee puts us on it not as Gods worke, but as <hi>our ≈ønare,</hi> hee moves us to it meerly as a <hi>≈øcruple,</hi> and to ≈øcruple us further, whether we do it, or do not doe it; he puts us on <hi>duty,</hi> not to <hi>comfort</hi> us, but to <hi>torment</hi> us and vex us, not to <hi>rai≈øe</hi> us when we are <hi>deiected,</hi> but to <hi>ca≈øt</hi> us lower, though he be often mi≈øtaken.</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170645:117"/>
            <p>But yet though Satan doth ≈øometime as you ≈øee, yet Gods Spirit doth often move and ≈øtirre up the heart to dutie, and when he <hi>moves</hi> indeed, he <hi>moves effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> he puts you on the <hi>dutie,</hi> and gives you <hi>≈øtrength</hi> to doe it, he carryes you through it, &amp;c. And it is good to ob≈øerve Gods times, the hints of the Spirit, and goe with them, which is the fir≈øt An≈øwer to that mi≈øtake.</p>
            <p>But though we are to <hi>goe</hi> when Gods Spirit <hi>moves,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">

            <p>Be≈øides, if you looke for an <hi>immediate</hi> call upon the dutie, then you will not do dutie out of <hi>obedience</hi> to the command.

            <p>For the fir≈øt, what is meant by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Rewards may be ≈øaid to be of a <hi>threefold</hi> nature. 1. Temporall. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. 3. Eternall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Temporall,</hi> and tho≈øe are all kinde of <hi>mercies</hi> we enjoy in this life, whether <hi>per≈øonall,</hi> or <hi>relative,</hi> and tho≈øe <hi>po≈øitive,</hi> or <hi>privative,</hi> health, comfort, food, rayment, hou≈øe, harbour, riches, freedome, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. ‚Äî</p>

            <p n="2">2. What is meant by <hi>Eying</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

            <p>There is a <hi>threefold</hi> eye.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man ≈øees and <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>excellency</hi> of a thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> whereby he beleeves the <hi>truth</hi> of it, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An eye of <hi>hope,</hi> and thereupon of patience, and waiting or <hi>expectation</hi> for the injoyment of it.</p>
            <p>In the≈øe <hi>re≈øpects, Mo≈øes</hi> might be ≈øaid to <hi>eye</hi> the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He <hi>eyed</hi> it by knowledge, he <hi>knew</hi> tho≈øe things which were <hi>laid</hi> up for him, he ≈øaw him that was <hi>invi≈øible,</hi> as the next ver≈øe tels us; and <hi>he</hi> ≈øaw tho≈øe <hi>rewards</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:170645:141"/>which God had laid up for his people, farre to be preferred before the plea≈øures of ≈øinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He had an <hi>eye</hi> of Faith; Whereby he was <hi>per≈øwaded</hi> both of the truth of it, that ≈øuch things were <hi>re≈øerved,</hi> and of his part in them, and that he ≈øhould <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe</hi> this glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He had an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> to wait and expect the enjoyment of all this with patience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36.</p>
            <p>And now hereupon he <hi>e≈øteemed</hi> the <hi>reproach</hi> of Chri≈øt above all the <hi>trea≈øures</hi> of Egypt, for ≈øaith the Text: <hi>He had an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi> What's that? ≈øhall we ≈øay, he had <hi>re≈øpect</hi> to that glory which hee ≈øhould <hi>purcha≈øe</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, by doing of this, or for doing this.

Therefore he did <hi>de≈øpi≈øe</hi> all the riches and plea≈øures of the world, as not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it. Agreeable to which are tho≈øe places, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. And thus much for the ≈øecond, we come now to the third.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether to doe duties with an <hi>eye,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. I an≈øwer, if you take it thus as I have ≈øaid, for <hi>knowing, beleeving, hoping;</hi> expecting of that glory God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to us; then I ≈øay, it is no <hi>infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of Chri≈øtian libertie, to doe duties with an eye to the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

            <p>In briefe then if you take this <hi>eyeing</hi> of the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward as I have ≈øaid, then a man may doe <hi>duties</hi> with an eye to the <hi>recompence</hi> of reward. And indeed we ought to doe them with ≈øuch an eye to the recompence of reward. 1. Vpon knowledge, faith, per≈øwa≈øion, that God will ble≈ø≈øe us, and never depart from us, from doing us good. 2. And upon knowledge, faith, per≈øwa≈øion, that God is our Father, that our ≈øinnes are pardoned, &amp;c. 3. And upon the like knowledge, faith and per≈øwa≈øion that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170645:142"/>God will glorifie us at la≈øt, thereupon we are to obey &amp; <hi>give</hi> up our ≈øelves to all the <hi>wayes</hi> of obedience, love and ≈øervice of God, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>And what ever you doe, doe heartily to the Lord, knowing that of the Lord you ≈øhall receive the reward of the inheritance.</hi> But if by <hi>eyeing</hi> of the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you meane thus, whether we are not to <hi>doe</hi> duties, in <hi>reference</hi> to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> of ≈øpirituall, temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mercies, then I mu≈øt <hi>pau≈øe,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer you by ≈øome di≈øtinctions.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>que≈øtion</hi> be demanded, 1. of temporall good things. <hi>Whether may not</hi> a <hi>man do duties and obey God in</hi> reference <hi>to Gods be≈øtowing of outward mercies and inioyments upon him in this life.</hi> The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative whereof, <hi>viz:</hi> (that a man may <hi>obey</hi> God with an <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>re≈øpect</hi> to Gods <hi>be≈øtowing</hi> of outward mercies, and good things in this life) is held up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by holy and learned men, ≈øuch as I beleeve doe <hi>carry</hi> as little eye to the≈øe things as any doe, in their obedience. And this is <hi>maintained</hi> upon the former grounds, becau≈øe God hath propounded the≈øe things as <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>incentives</hi> to obedience, and the <hi>be≈øt of Saints</hi> have <hi>eyed</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:170645:143"/>them in their obedience, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we may do it al≈øo.

By [good things] here I conceive is meant, <hi>outward</hi> good things, and tho≈øe ≈øuch as the <hi>world</hi> doe reckon and e≈øteeme to be <hi>good things,</hi> as riches, honour, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, applau≈øe; at lea≈øt, a <hi>competency</hi> and ≈øufficiency of <hi>temporall</hi> and outward good things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And by [≈øerving God] I conceive is meant all the <hi>acts</hi> of obedience, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outward <hi>conformitie,</hi> but inward <hi>≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</hi> to the <hi>lawes</hi> and commands of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And by [eying] of the≈øe <hi>temporall</hi> good things in ≈øervice, I conceive, is not meant the <hi>making</hi> the≈øe things either the <hi>meere</hi> or <hi>maine</hi> grounds of his obedience, nor the <hi>≈øupreame</hi> and primary <hi>ends</hi> and aymes of his ≈øervice, for that were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, but carrying a <hi>re≈øpect</hi> unto the <hi>inioyment</hi> of the≈øe things, as a ≈øubordinate ground to ≈øet him on worke, and a means to <hi>quicken</hi> him in working. And thus I have rendred the be≈øt ≈øen≈øe I can, of tho≈øe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170645:144"/>particulars in the Query, and the que≈øtion being thus ≈øtated; I ≈øhall now come to the An≈øwer. In which I conceive I ≈øhall have the grant of three particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>inioyment</hi> of the≈øe good things of this life, is not the <hi>ground</hi> of a Chri≈øtian mans obedience; they are not that which doth put us on worke, though they ≈øhould be <hi>admitted</hi> to quicken us in working, they are not the <hi>≈øpring</hi> of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the mo≈øt they are but <hi>oyle</hi> to the wheeles to keep on and <hi>quicken</hi> motion. I conceive there are the≈øe <hi>grounds</hi> of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>binding</hi> grounds: and tho≈øe are becau≈øe God hath commanded, as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou ha≈øt commanded us to keep thy precepts, oh that my heart were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to keep thy ≈øtatutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>inabling</hi> grounds. Tho≈øe are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our <hi>implantation</hi> into Chri≈øt; As <hi>without him we can doe nothing,</hi> ≈øo <hi>in him we are created to all good works, and I can doe all things through Chri≈øt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chri≈øts <hi>implantation</hi> into us, which is called the <hi>forming</hi> of Chri≈øt in the ≈øoul, the <hi>new</hi> man, the law <hi>written</hi> in the heart,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170645:145"/>the <hi>new</hi> creatures, faith &amp; love, whereby we are inabled to obey his precepts: our faith <hi>inables.</hi> By faith <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed ‚Äî and our love con≈øtraines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impelling</hi> grounds, and tho≈øe are motives rather; 1. becau≈øe <hi>God</hi> is good, 2. becau≈øe he hath been <hi>good</hi> to us. Gods goodne≈ø≈øe is a motive, and his grace is our ≈øtrength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>inioyment</hi> of the≈øe things, they are not the <hi>meere</hi> end of a Chri≈øtians obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then would it <hi>render</hi> us to be ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and <hi>mercenary</hi> in our obedience, and not <hi>Son-like</hi> and free. Indeed the≈øe may be the <hi>meere ends</hi> of the <hi>obedience</hi> of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, but not of the godly, they have <hi>higher</hi> ends then the≈øe: The≈øe are too low for the noble and <hi>royall</hi> ≈øpirits of Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are not the <hi>main</hi> ends of their obedience, they have <hi>higher</hi> ends then the≈øe are; A Chri≈øtian hath a more <hi>noble</hi> ≈øpirit, a more <hi>free-borne</hi> ≈øoule, then to make any <hi>thing</hi> out of God him≈øelfe, the <hi>maine</hi> end of his obedience to God. And ≈øo farre all agree.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>controver≈øie</hi> is about the next, which I de≈øire to <hi>propound</hi> in mode≈øty, to tho≈øe who are of <hi>different</hi> judgements.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:170645:145"/>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it can be ≈øaid to be the <hi>≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> end of a Chri≈øtians obedience Seeing,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ≈øeemes to bee the <hi>paedagogy</hi> of the Law, in which time they ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>carryed</hi> by temporall promi≈øes in the wayes of obedience, and God ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>propound</hi> to them as men under age, the promi≈øes of <hi>temporall</hi> good things to <hi>tempt</hi> them on to obedience. As you ≈øee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. Certainly, the injoyment of the≈øe temporall things was not the <hi>meere</hi> end of their obedience; though ≈øome of them might have the ≈øpirit of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who ≈øaid, they <hi>kept</hi> the Law, and ob≈øerved it, that God might <hi>ble≈ø≈øe</hi> them, and that it might goe well with them in this life; yet <hi>all</hi> were not of this ≈øpirit: nor was the injoyment of the≈øe things, the <hi>maine</hi> end of their obedience no more then of ours: It was but a <hi>≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> end, God never <hi>propounded</hi> it, nor did the godly <hi>eye</hi> it, as the <hi>maine</hi> end of their obedience. But God deales with them as in their <hi>infancy,</hi> as under age, and leads them on, and <hi>allures</hi> them by ≈øuch <hi>re≈øpects</hi> as the≈øe; becau≈øe they had not that <hi>mea≈øure</hi> and abundance of ≈øpirit
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170645:146"/>which hee hath <hi>be≈øtowed</hi> on his people now under the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe it ≈øeemes to <hi>pre≈øcribe</hi> God, and limit God, not ≈øubmitting to his wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in de≈øpo≈øals to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe it ≈øeemes to <hi>propound</hi> that which God hath not propounded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becau≈øe this end may faile, and ≈øo our <hi>obedience</hi> too, at lea≈øt, ≈øo much as the≈øe things were the <hi>end</hi> of our obedience, ≈øo much <hi>obedience</hi> will faile in the failing of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is hard to carry an <hi>eye</hi> to things of this nature, and yet our <hi>≈øervice</hi> be free.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I conceive it is <hi>≈øafer</hi> to take up <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> to quicken us in our obedience of God, from the <hi>mercies</hi> of God <hi>be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or made ours in the promi≈øe to faith, then for to take up <hi>arguments</hi> to obey from the <hi>expectation</hi> of mercy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed, or to gaine mercies by our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It ≈øeemes better to ≈øay, that we are not to obey that God may <hi>be≈øtow</hi> ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings on us, but rather upon the <hi>knowledge,</hi> faith, per≈øwa≈øion of Gods ble≈ø≈øing of us here and for ever, to be <hi>quickned</hi> from that to obey him. And the Apo≈øtle ≈øeems to ≈øpeake after the ≈øame manner to us,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170645:146"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore the≈øe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promi≈øes, let us clean≈øe our ≈øelves from all filthine≈ø≈øe both of fle≈øh and ≈øpirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holine≈ø≈øe in the feare of God.</hi> He argues from mercy to dutie, not from dutie to mercy here. He rea≈øons here from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of promi≈øes to the performance of obedience; <hi>having therefore ≈øuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, let us obey.</hi> So in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>And what≈øoever you doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord, and not to man; Knowing that of the Lord you ≈øhall receive the reward of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:</hi> where you ≈øee he takes up the <hi>argument,</hi> to inforce the <hi>dutie</hi> from the knowledge, or faith and per≈øwa≈øion of that reward which God will <hi>a≈ø≈øuredly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow on them. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They tooke ioyfully the ≈øpoiling of their goods, knowing in them≈øelves that they had in heaven, a better and an enduring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> But I am not here to deale with <hi>eternall,</hi> but with <hi>temporall</hi> rewards, and urge the≈øe places no further then to <hi>≈øtrengthen</hi> what I ≈øaid before, that it ≈øeemes better to ≈øay, that we doe not <hi>obey</hi> that God may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow the≈øe outward <hi>ble≈ø≈øings</hi> on us, but rather upon the <hi>knowledge,</hi> faith, per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Gods <hi>ble≈øsing</hi> us here, and for ever, we are <hi>quickned</hi> to obey him, and in our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170645:147"/>obedience of him. And certainly the le≈ø≈øe <hi>eye</hi> that we carry to the≈øe things <hi>in</hi> our obedience, the more eye will God <hi>carry</hi> to our obedience, the le≈ø≈øe <hi>regard</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect you have to the≈øe outward things in your ≈øervice, the more will God <hi>re≈øpect</hi> &amp; regard your ≈øervice, the le≈ø≈øe you make them the <hi>end</hi> of your working, the more will God make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the <hi>end</hi> of your work; Indeed the injoyment of <hi>outward</hi> things ≈øeeme to be too <hi>low</hi> for a Chri≈øtian to eye them in his obedience, the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>We looke not at the things which are ≈øeene, but at the things which are not ≈øeene: for the things which are ≈øeene are temporall, but the things which are not ≈øeene are eternall.</hi>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170645:167"/>him: It is not the <hi>bloud</hi> within his veines, the <hi>≈øpirits</hi> within his arteries, the <hi>life</hi> within his body, that can be too <hi>deare</hi> to be laid out for him: now all the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt</hi> is, not what will God <hi>give</hi> me, but what ≈øhall I <hi>give</hi> God? <hi>What ≈øhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Lord for all his goodne≈ø≈øe?</hi> he is <hi>willing</hi> to goe through a <hi>≈øea</hi> and through a <hi>wilderne≈ø≈øe,</hi> through any <hi>difficulties,</hi> any <hi>duties;</hi> and all he can doe it fals <hi>infinitely</hi> ≈øhort of his <hi>heart</hi> and good will to God; all his <hi>expre≈ø≈øions</hi> they are but a little of his <hi>larger</hi> affections in him; and though God ≈øhould never doe <hi>more</hi> for him, yet his heart doth <hi>burne</hi> with ≈øuch affections to God, that he counts <hi>all</hi> he can doe for him, but a <hi>little</hi> of that much he could beteeme him.</p>
            <p>And now though I did not need to <hi>proceed</hi> any further in this, yet give me leave, becau≈øe this is the maine in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie,</hi> yet to proceed a little further in the clearing of it to you. For an≈øwer then to this third <hi>branch</hi> of the Query, <hi>Whether a Chri≈øtian man may not doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with an eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> or with re≈øpect to heaven and glory. I an≈øwer <hi>affirmatively,</hi> and in <hi>oppo≈øition</hi> to that contrary opinion, I ≈øhall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170645:167"/>lay downe and <hi>evidence</hi> the≈øe two po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Po≈øition. <hi>That we may obey God with respect to heaven and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Po≈øition. <hi>That we ought to have respect to heaven and glory in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe two <hi>po≈øitions</hi> I ≈øhall indevour to <hi>e≈øtabli≈øh</hi> to you, though not upon the ≈øame <hi>grounds</hi> whereon the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>reward</hi> in our obedience is <hi>u≈øually</hi> built: I ≈øhall labour to ≈øettle it upon ≈øuch <hi>≈øpirituall</hi> and yet <hi>true</hi> grounds, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ≈øhall ≈øee the <hi>rea≈øon</hi> of our di≈ø≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fir≈øt <hi>branch</hi> of the Query. We will beginne with the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> which is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Po≈ø. <hi>That it is lawfull, and we may obey God with respect to eternall rewards, heaven and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>handling</hi> of this, in regard I <hi>find</hi> that tho≈øe who have <hi>maintained</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, have grounded that <hi>opinion</hi> upon mi≈øtakes, and <hi>fal≈øe</hi> conceptions of what <hi>heaven</hi> and glory is: I find they have made <hi>fal≈øe draughts</hi> of heaven, and have too much <hi>pen≈øild</hi> it out after a carnall manner; a way farre below heaven and glory. And thereupon I conceive, have
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170645:168"/>grounded this opinion, that we may not eye it in our obedience. I ≈øhall therefore in the fir≈øt place (having in the <hi>entrance</hi> upon the <hi>Query</hi> cleared what was meant by <hi>respect,</hi> or eying of the reward) ≈øet downe now what we <hi>conceive</hi> is truely meant by <hi>heaven</hi> and glory.</p>
            <p>And here I mu≈øt <hi>fir≈øt</hi> tell you, that if you do <hi>ab≈øtract</hi> or ≈øeparate that <hi>from heaven</hi> which a <hi>carnall</hi> heart doth <hi>conceive</hi> to be heaven, that is <hi>heaven</hi> to a godly man. Carnall men doe <hi>fancie</hi> heaven under car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall notions; they looke upon it as <hi>a place</hi> where there is <hi>freedome</hi> from all mi≈øery; and where there is <hi>fulne≈ø≈øe</hi> of all plea≈øures and happine≈ø≈øe: but both the≈øe, the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery</hi> and the <hi>happine≈ø≈øe,</hi> the freedome and injoyment; they <hi>fancie</hi> in a way ≈øutable and <hi>complying</hi> with their carnall or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hearts. This indeed is a <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but this is not a <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: indeed we read <hi>heaven</hi> ≈øet out <hi>≈øumptuou≈øly</hi> to us in the Scripture,
<note place="margin">Revel. 21.18, 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.18, 19. <hi>The wals thereof are Iasper, and the Citie is of pure gold, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof are garni≈øhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious ≈øtones; the fir≈øt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of Iasper, ‚Äî and the twelve Gates are twelve Pearles,</hi> ‚Äî thus God
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170645:168"/>is plea≈øed to <hi>pen≈øil</hi> it out, as if he would <hi>tempt</hi> a worldling, and even <hi>corrupt ≈øen≈øe</hi> it ≈øelfe which ≈øhall never come there, to ≈øeeke the <hi>inioyment</hi> of it. But the≈øe you mu≈øt know are <hi>metaphoricall</hi> ≈øpeeches, becau≈øe the <hi>glory</hi> of heaven cannot be <hi>pen≈øild</hi> and lim'd out as it is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth <hi>conde≈øcend</hi> here to our weakene≈ø≈øe, and even to <hi>≈øen≈øe</hi> it ≈øelfe; and <hi>pen≈øils</hi> out heaven and glory by ≈øuch things as are <hi>knowne</hi> to men to be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Not that we are to <hi>conceive</hi> that heaven is <hi>any</hi> ≈øuch thing; nay, or that there is any <hi>≈øuch thing</hi> in heaven; if you thinke ≈øo, I ≈øhall <hi>≈øpoyle</hi> your heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done; certainly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God needs not to be <hi>beholding</hi> to ≈øtones, though <hi>precious</hi> ≈øtones, to make <hi>heaven</hi> glorious, no more then the <hi>Sunne</hi> needs to be <hi>beholding</hi> to the <hi>Starres</hi> to make the day. God him≈øelfe <hi>fils</hi> heaven with Glory, and makes it <hi>infinitely</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. God in <hi>heaven</hi> is the <hi>glory</hi> of heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To what purpo≈øe ≈øhould there be ≈øuch poore <hi>beggerly</hi> ≈øen≈øitive things, to tho≈øe who are <hi>all ≈øpirit</hi> and glory? the≈øe things are <hi>below</hi> the ≈øpirit of a godly man here; he hath a more <hi>noble</hi> ≈øpirit, he can

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Be≈øides, the≈øe are but <hi>beggerly</hi> glory, to the <hi>meane≈øt</hi> glory in heaven; you ≈øhall turne your <hi>eyes</hi> no whither but <hi>behold</hi> a farre greater <hi>glory</hi> then the≈øe are; every <hi>glorified</hi> ≈øoule <hi>≈øhall be more glorious then the Sunne in its glory:</hi> alas, what are <hi>precious</hi> ≈øtones, but <hi>pebble</hi> ≈øtones, if <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> to the glory of a glorified Saint?</p>
            <p>But to <hi>proceed</hi> no <hi>further,</hi> upon the mi≈øtake.

<note n="*" place="margin">Burrows, Mo≈øes <hi>choice.</hi> 529.</note> others have excellently done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>fruition</hi> and injoyment of God.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Be ware of <hi>abu≈øing</hi> of it. Chri≈øtian libertie is a <hi>precious</hi> thing; and the more <hi>precious,</hi> the more care not to abu≈øe it; precious things doe u≈øe to be <hi>commended</hi> to us with words of Caution; Chri≈øtian libertie is a <hi>precious</hi> thing, you ≈øee it was <hi>dearely</hi> purcha≈øed, and <hi>mercifully</hi> be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, and therefore let me <hi>≈øubioyne</hi> this Caution, and ≈øo conclude. Beware of <hi>abu≈øing</hi> of it. Now that I may not ≈øpeake
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170645:191"/>in the ayre, there are ≈øixe wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chri≈øtian libertie is abu≈øed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We abu≈øe Chri≈øtian <hi>libertie,</hi> when in the u≈øe of it we <hi>≈øcandall</hi> others: libertie was <hi>purcha≈øed</hi> for the <hi>comfort</hi> of our ≈øelves, not for the <hi>affliction</hi> of others; they abu≈øe it indeed, who ≈øo u≈øe it, as to others <hi>affliction.</hi> We reade of ≈øome young <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> of Corinth would eate meat <hi>offered</hi> to Idols, to that end onely to <hi>≈øhew</hi> their libertie: But the Apo≈øtle tels them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is frequent in <hi>in≈øtructing</hi> them, how to <hi>exerci≈øe</hi> Chri≈øtian libertie in ca≈øe of <hi>≈øcandall. Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Brethren you have been called unto libertie, onely u≈øe not libertie for an occa≈øion to the fle≈øh, but by love ≈øerve one another.</hi> Chri≈øt hath <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> off our former yoake of bondage, not that we ≈øhould be more <hi>Wanton,</hi> but more <hi>carefull:</hi> Indeed for the <hi>comfort</hi> of our ≈øelves, but not to <hi>de≈øtroy</hi> another, as the Apo≈øtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Through thy knowledge ≈øhall thy weake brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh for whom Chri≈øt dyed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I will <hi>ha≈øten</hi> to a conclu≈øion, and therefore will <hi>≈øhut</hi> up all in a word.</p>
            <pb n="350" facs="tcp:170645:192"/>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>≈øecond</hi> way, whereby we doe <hi>abu≈øe</hi> our Chri≈øtian <hi>libertie;</hi> and that is when we <hi>u≈øe</hi> it to <hi>≈øuper≈øtition,</hi> many will ≈øay they have <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> libertie; and therefore dare <hi>venture</hi> upon any <hi>ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> cu≈øtomes and ge≈øtures, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>warranted</hi> by the Word; this indeed is <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> licenciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, not <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> libertie; Chri≈øtian libertie is yet a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed libertie, bounded with Laws and Rules; but the≈øe are men within no bounds, and therefore Libertines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We doe <hi>abu≈øe</hi> it when we make <hi>void</hi> the law of God; as I have ≈øhewed you at large, when we ≈øhall <hi>iudge</hi> it our <hi>libertie</hi> to be <hi>exempted</hi> from dutie; which indeed is true <hi>bondage,</hi> no Chri≈øtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. The <hi>libertie</hi> of a Chri≈øtian lies not in <hi>exemption</hi> from ≈øervice, but in <hi>≈øervice;</hi> ≈øurely that man is yet in <hi>bondage</hi> who doth not judge <hi>≈øervice</hi> his libertie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we give too much <hi>≈øcope</hi> to our ≈øelves in <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>lawfull.</hi> It is an <hi>ea≈øie</hi> thing to <hi>runne</hi> from u≈øe to abu≈øe; of ≈øuch men <hi>Iude</hi> ≈øpeakes in the 4. ver≈øe of that Epi≈øtle: <hi>There are certaine men turne the grace of God into wantonne≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When we doe <hi>u≈øe</hi> it <hi>undutifully;</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:170645:192"/>denying <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>lawfull Authoritie</hi> in things <hi>lawfull</hi> upon pretence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian <hi>lihertie;</hi> which is indeed to make the <hi>world</hi> levell; and throw downe all <hi>lawfull</hi> Authoritie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When we will be <hi>tied</hi> to nothing, <hi>bound</hi> to nothing but what our owne ≈øpirits <hi>incline</hi> us to; of which I have ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large: and therefore I ≈øhall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> all with the <hi>words</hi> of the Apo≈øtle, in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>You are free, yet u≈øe not your libertie for a cloake of maliciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but as the ≈øervants of God.</hi>
